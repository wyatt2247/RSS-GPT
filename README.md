If you need a web GUI to manage feeds better, check out my latest project: [RSSBrew](https://github.com/yinan-c/RSSBrew), a self-hosted RSS-GPT alternative with more features and customizability, built with Django.

## What is this?

[Configuration Guide](https://yinan-c.github.io/rss-gpt-manual-en.html) | [中文简介](README-zh.md) | [中文教程](https://yinan-c.github.io/rss-gpt-manual-zh.html)

Using GitHub Actions to run a simple Python script repeatedly: Calling OpenAI API to generate summaries for RSS feeds, and push the generated feeds to GitHub Pages. Easy to configure, no server needed.

### Features

- Use ChatGPT to summarize RSS feeds, and attach summaries to the original articles, support custom summary length and target language.
- Aggregate multiple RSS feeds into one, remove duplicate articles, subscribe with a single address.
- Add filters to your own personalized RSS feeds.
- Host your own RSS feeds on GitHub repo and GitHub Pages.

## ChangeLog and updates

- As OpenAI released a new version of `openai` package on Nov 06, 2023.  [More powerful models are coming](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday), the way to call API also changed. As a result, the old script will no longer work with the latest version installed, and needs to be updated. Otherwise, you will have to set `openai==0.27.8` in `requirements.txt` to use the old version.
-  In the latest updates, **contexts longer than 16k tokens are no longer truncated, instead, will use the `gpt-4-1106-preview` model.** If you don't like this, let me know and I'll think about adding customizability to choose whether truncate or use `gpt-4-1106-preview` model.
- Check out the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
