<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES), which could allow for authentication bypass. GHES is a popular platform for software developers. Organizations can build and store software applications using Git version control and automate deployment pipelines. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow for an attacker to forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user with site administrator privileges. An attacker could then view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
