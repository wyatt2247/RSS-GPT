A suspected Russian hybrid espionage and influence operation has been observed delivering a mix of Windows and Android malware to target the Ukrainian military under the Telegram persona Civil Defense.
Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant are tracking the activity under the name UNC5812. The threat group, which operates a Telegram channel named civildefense_com_ua, was created on

According to the newly released report of the Mandiant cybersecurity firm, after an analysis of 138 exploits published in 2023, on average, in five days an attacker already exploits a vulnerability. Because of this speed, very soon it has become paramount for organisations to make their system updates quickly. The study, published by Google Cloud bloggers, shows that this trend has greatly reduced the time taken for attackers to exploit both unknown vulnerabilities, known as zero-day, and known ones, called N-day.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Speed in the Exploitation Going Up</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As indicated by Mandiant research, the time-to-exploit, which is a statistic indicating the average number of days taken by attackers to exploit a discovered vulnerability, has been reducing rapidly. During 2018, it took nearly 63 days for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities. However, in the case of 2023, hackers took merely five days for exploitation. This shows that the attackers are getting more efficient in exploiting those security vulnerabilities before the application developers could patch them satisfactorily.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Zero-Day and N-Day Vulnerabilities</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The report makes a distinction between the zero-day vulnerabilities, being the undisclosed and unpatched flaws that attackers would exploit immediately, and N-day vulnerabilities, which are already known flaws that attackers aim at after patches have already been released. In the year 2023, types of vulnerabilities targeted by the attackers changed, with rates of zero-day exploitation, which rose to a ratio of 30:70 compared with N-day attacks. This trend shows that attackers now prefer zero-day exploits, which may be because they allow immediate access to systems and sensitive data before the vulnerability is known to the world.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Timing and Frequency of Exploitation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This again proves that N-day vulnerabilities are at their most vulnerable state during the first few weeks when the patch is released. Of the observed N-day vulnerabilities, 56% happened within the first month after a patch was released. Besides, 5% were attacked within just one day of the patch release while 29% attacked in the first week after release. This fast pace is something that makes the patches really important to apply to organizations as soon as possible after they are available.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Widening Scope for Attack Targets</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the past ten years, attackers have enormously widened their scope of attacks by targeting a growing list of vendors. According to the report, on this front, the count increased from 25 in the year 2018 to 56 in 2023. The widening of such a nature increases the trouble for teams, who have now encountered a significantly expanded attack surface along with the ever-increasing possibility of attacks at a number of systems and software applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Case Studies Exposing Different Exploits</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Mandiant has published case studies on how attackers exploit vulnerabilities. For example, CVE-2023-28121 is a vulnerability in the WooCommerce Payments plugin for WordPress, which was published in March 2023. Although it had been previously secure, it became highly exploited after the technical details of how to exploit the flaw were published online. Attacks started a day after the release of a weaponized tool, peaking to 1.3 million attacks in one day. This fast growth shows how easy certain vulnerabilities can be in high demand by attackers when tools to exploit are generally available.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The case of the CVE-2023-27997 vulnerability that occurred with respect to the Secure Sockets Layer in Fortinet's FortiOS was another type that had a different timeline when it came to the attack. Even though media alert was very much all over when the vulnerability was first brought to the limelight, it took them about two or three months before executing the attack. This may probably be because of the difficulty with which the exploit needs to be carried out since there will be the use of intricate techniques to achieve it. On the other hand, the exploit for the WooCommerce plugin was quite easier where it only required the presence of an HTTP header.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Complexity of Patching Systems</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">While patching in due time is very essential, this is not that easy especially when updating such patches across massive systems. The CEO at Quarkslab says that Fred Raynal stated that patching two or three devices is feasible; however, patching thousands of them requires much coordination and lots of resources. Secondly, the complexity of patching in devices like a mobile phone is immense due to multiple layers which are required for updates to finally reach a user.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some critical systems, like energy platforms or healthcare devices, have patching issues more difficult than others. System reliability and uninterrupted operation in such systems may be placed above the security updates. According to Raynal, companies in some instances even ban patching because of the risks of operational disruptions, leaving some of the devices with known vulnerabilities unpatched.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Urgency of Timely Patching</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Says Mandiant, it is such an attack timeline that organisations face the threat of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities faster than ever before. This is the report's finding while stating that it requires more than timely patching to stay ahead of attackers to secure the increasingly complex and multi-layered systems that make up more and more of the world's digital infrastructure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

This campaign, discovered by Kaspersky researchers, consists of a multi-layered assault chain that includes social engineering, a fake game website, and a zero-day flaw in Google Chrome.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The report claims that in May 2024, Kaspersky Total Security identified a new attack chain that used the Manuscrypt backdoor to target the personal computer of an unidentified Russian citizen.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Kaspersky researchers Boris Larin and Vasily Berdnikov believe the campaign began in February 2024. After investigating the attack further, analysts discovered that the attackers had developed a website called "detankzonecom" that seemed to be a genuine platform for the game "DeFiTankZone."&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This game reportedly combines Decentralised Finance (DeFi) elements with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) situation. The website even offers a downloadable trial edition, adding to the look of trustworthiness. However, beneath the surface is a malicious trap.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“Under the hood, this website had a hidden script that ran in the user’s Google Chrome browser, launching a zero-day exploit and giving the attackers complete control over the victim’s PC,” researchers noted.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The exploit contains code for two vulnerabilities: one that enables hackers to access the whole address space of the Chrome process using JavaScript (CVE-2024-4947), and the other that allows attackers to circumvent the V8 sandbox and access memory outside the confines of the register array.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Google addressed CVE-2024-4947, a type confusion flaw in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, in March 2024, although it's unknown if attackers discovered it first and weaponised it as a zero-day or exploited it as an N-day flaw.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In this campaign, Lazarus has used social media sites like LinkedIn and X (previously Twitter) to target prominent players in the cryptocurrency field. With several accounts on X, they created a social media presence and actively promoted the fake game. They also hired graphic designers and generative AI to create amazing advertising material for the DeTankZone game. The group also sent carefully designed messages to interested parties pretending to be blockchain startups or game developers looking for funding.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This campaign highlights how the Lazarus Group's strategies have changed. It is crucial to be wary of unsolicited investment opportunities, particularly when they involve dubious social media promotions or downloadable game clients. In order to mitigate the risk of zero-day attacks, it is also crucial to maintain browser software, such as Chrome, updated with the most recent security fixes.</span></div></span>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>CRIL has come across a multi-stage cyberattack <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/18e75bababa1176ca1b25f727c0362e4bb31ffc19c17e2cabb6519e6ef9d2fe5/community">campaign</a> that begins with a ZIP file containing a malicious shortcut file (.lnk). While the source of this ZIP file remains unknown, it is suspected to be disseminated through phishing emails. Based on the LNK <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5ff89db10969cba73d1f539b12dad42c60314e580ce43d7b57b46a1f915a6a2b/details">file name</a>, it is suspected that this campaign targets the healthcare industry.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Upon execution, the LNK file triggers a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a series of additional payloads, including PowerShell scripts and BAT files, from a remote server. These scripts work in tandem to create a new user account on the compromised system with administrative privileges and modify Terminal Services (RDP) settings, lowering authentication requirements. This setup enables the TAs to easily establish remote desktop access (RDP) to the victim's system, facilitating further malicious activities such as data exfiltration, the installation of additional <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/">malware</a>, or even system monitoring.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Furthermore, CRIL identified the presence of an unwanted application called “ChromePass” within the threat actors' network infrastructure. This hacking tool is designed to steal saved passwords from Chromium-based browsers, adding another layer of risk for victims by exposing their credentials. The image below illustrates the infection chain.</p>

<p>Based on the information obtained through pivoting, this group has been operational since 2023&nbsp;and has executed a range of <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/">attacks</a> across different sectors, as reflected in the names of the lure files. While the overall attack flow has remained consistent, it is surprising that they are still active using the same techniques. Several researchers have previously identified this campaign <a href="https://x.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1701669714244542758">[1]</a>,<a href="https://x.com/AzakaSekai_/status/1846482785009348692">[2]</a>,<a href="https://x.com/fmc_nan/status/1701427951714345296">[3]</a>,<a href="https://x.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1708219656488571188">[4]</a>,<a href="https://x.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1701672325580550176">[5]</a>, with the majority of findings shared by the Malware Hunter Team.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campaign analysis</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, this unidentified group has consistently reemerged with various lure themes while maintaining unchanged attack patterns. Tracked as HeptaX,' the campaign relies heavily on PowerShell and Batch scripts to gain control over compromised systems. By pivoting the IP address, we uncovered several additional artifacts associated with the same TAs used across different campaigns.</p>

<p>As an initial step, the downloaded PowerShell script constructs a base URL to which it sends information and from which it downloads other stage payloads. The PowerShell script contains multiple functions, the first of which retrieves a unique identifier (UID) for the compromised system. This UID is obtained either from a specific registry path (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wireless) or from a log file (<em>id.log</em>) in the <em>“C:\Users\Public\Documents</em>” directory. If neither exists, a new GUID is generated and saved to a newly created id.log file.</p>

<p>Next, the PowerShell script creates a shortcut file in the Windows Startup folder for persistence. The contents of the newly generated LNK file match those of the original malicious LNK file. The image below shows the function responsible for creating the new LNK file in the startup folder.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Then, the PowerShell script constructs a URL by appending the previously generated UID to the remote server, forming the request <em>hxxp://157.173.104.153/up/get-command.php?uid=&lt;UID</em>&gt;, and uses <em>WebClient</em> to send a request to fetch commands from the server. Upon receiving a successful response, it checks whether the response contains the string “autoreconnect”. If this string is present, the Powershell script runs the code in the current session using `iex`; otherwise, it executes the code as a background task in a separate PowerShell process.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Afterward, the PowerShell script downloads a password-protected lure document from the above-mentioned remote server, saves it in the system's temporary directory “<em>C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp</em>”, and then launches the document. The image below displays the function code and the open directory containing the lure PDF.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finally, the PowerShell script retrieves two registry values related to User Account Control (UAC):</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin, which controls the consent prompt behavior for administrators.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA, which indicates whether UAC is enabled.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If either of these values is 0, suggesting that UAC is either disabled or configured to a less secure setting, the script proceeds to download and execute another PowerShell script (<em>b.ps1</em>) from the remote server.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":69375,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Payload, Code" class="wp-image-69375" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Figure-13-Code-to-download-next-stage-payload.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 13 - Code to download next stage payload</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Second Stage – b.ps1</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The newly downloaded second-stage PowerShell script includes several functions, some mirroring those from the first stage. The primary function of this script is focused on evaluating the system's User Account Control (UAC) settings, utilizing the same registry checks employed earlier to determine whether UAC is enabled and if the consent prompt for administrators remains active.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If UAC is disabled or the consent prompt behavior is configured to a less secure state, the function sends a message to the remote server indicating that UAC is off by default: ("hxxp://157.173.104[.]153/up/index.php?uid=$uid&amp;msg=UAC off in default!").</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If both settings are enabled, the function enters a loop, repeatedly attempting to disable UAC by setting the “ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin” value to 0. Once successful, it sends a message to the remote server stating that UAC has been forcefully disabled: ("hxxp://157.173.104[.]153/up/index.php?uid=$uid&amp;msg=UAC force disabled!"). The below image shows the function code responsible for sending a POST request to the remote server, transmitting information about the victim's User Account Control (UAC) status.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After a brief 300-millisecond sleep, the PowerShell script calls the <em>schReg()</em> function, which downloads three batch files from the remote server into the system’s temporary directory ($env:TEMP). The files are named “<em>k1.bat</em><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">,” “<em>scheduler-once.bat</em>,” and “<em>k2.bat</em>.” After downloading, the script runs the “<em>scheduler-once.bat”</em> file using the “Start-Process” cmdlet with elevated privileges. The image below shows the code responsible for downloading and executing the batch files</span>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":69377,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Third Stage - scheduler-once.bat</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The executed batch file copies “<em>k1.bat</em>” and “<em>k2.bat”</em> from the %temp% directory to “<em>C:\Windows\System32”</em>, renaming them to “<em>sysmon.bat”</em> and “<em>sysmon2.bat”</em>. It then deletes the original “<em>k1.bat”</em> and “<em>k2.bat”</em> files from the temp location. Next, the batch file checks for and removes any scheduled tasks named:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Intel(R) Ethernet Connection 1219-LM</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Intel(R) Ethernet2 Connection 1219-LM</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Afterward, it creates a new scheduled task called "Intel(R) Ethernet2 Connection 1219-LM" to run “<em>sysmon2.bat”</em>. Finally, the script “<em>scheduler-once.bat</em>” deletes itself to cover its traces from the system. The image below displays the contents of the batch file “<em>scheduler-once.bat”</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":69379,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Fourth Stage – sysmon2.bat</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the scheduled task is triggered to execute the “<em>sysmon2.bat”</em> file, it first checks for and removes any existing scheduled tasks named:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Intel(R) Ethernet Connection 1219-LM2</li>

<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Intel(R) Ethernet2 Connection 1219-LM2</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Afterward, it creates a new scheduled task called “Intel(R) Ethernet2 Connection1219-LM2” to run the “<em>sysmon.bat”</em> file located in the “C:<em>Windows\System32”</em> folder. Notably, the previous third-stage batch file performs similar checks, but the task names differ slightly. The image below shows the content of the&nbsp;“<em>sysmon2.bat”</em> file.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Fifth Stage – Sysmon.bat</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The sysmon.bat script executes a series of actions:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Creates a new user account named “_<em>BootUEFI_</em>”.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Sets the password for this newly added account to “123456!!!” and activates it.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Adds the “_<em>BootUEFI_”</em> account to the Administrators group, granting it administrative privileges.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Adds the “_<em>BootUEFI_”</em> account to the Remote Desktop Users group, allowing it to utilize Remote Desktop.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Removes the “_<em>BootUEFI_”</em> account from the Users group, ensuring it retains only administrative and remote desktop privileges.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Additionally, the batch file makes several registry modifications to enable Remote Desktop and lower its security features. This includes hiding the “<strong>_</strong><em>BootUEFI<strong>_”</strong></em> user from the login screen and adjusting Terminal Services (Remote Desktop) settings to facilitate easier remote connections without stringent authentication requirements.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The batch file runs a PowerShell command that circumvents execution policy restrictions and adds the System32 directory, which contains the three malicious batch files, to the Windows Defender exclusion list.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Finally, it initiates a background PowerShell process that downloads and executes another PowerShell script from the remote server (hxxp://157.173.104[.]153/up/a.ps1).</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Sixth Stage – a.ps1</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The newly downloaded PowerShell script “<em>a.ps1”</em> functions similar to the first stage script (<em>bb.ps1</em>). It constructs a URL by appending the previously generated UID to the remote server address, forming a request to “<em>hxxp://157.173.104.153/up/get-command.php?uid=&lt;UID&gt;”</em>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The script then utilizes a WebClient to send a request and retrieve commands from the server. Upon receiving a response, it checks for the presence of the string "autoreconnect id." If this string is found, the PowerShell script executes the code in the current session using iex; otherwise, it runs the code as a background task in a separate PowerShell process. Notably, in both stages, we did not receive any specific commands such as "autoreconnect" or "autoreconnect id". The main difference in this sixth-stage script is that it looks for the string "autoreconnect id" instead of just "autoreconnect". The below image shows the code for reconnecting to the server.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Seventh Stage – Server response PowerShell Script</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Upon establishing a connection with the server, a new PowerShell script is executed. This script contains several functions aimed at system reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and interaction with the remote server.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The script collects detailed system information, including:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Computer name and username.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Retrieves recent files from the directory: <em>C:\Users\&lt;user profile>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent</em>.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Acquires network configuration details using “ipconfig /all”.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>List of users on the machine (net user).</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Obtains current logged-in user details.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Identifies local user groups associated with the current user.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Retrieves excluded directories in Windows Defender.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Lists installed antivirus products.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Captures running processes using “tasklist”.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Gathers overall system information using “systeminfo”.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>All this data is saved in a log file located at “<em>C:\Windows\Temp\OneDriveLog\OneDrive.log”</em>.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The script then reads the contents of the log file, converts the data into a byte array, and encodes it in Base64 format. This encoded data, along with the unique user ID (uid), is appended to the base URL” <em>hxxp://157.173.104[.]153/up/index.php</em>” and sent via a POST request. After successfully transmitting the data, the log file and its directory are deleted to eliminate any traces of the data collection.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Taking Remote desktop</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With all the collected information, User Account Control (UAC) disabled, and a new user account named “<em>BootUEFI</em>” created with administrative privileges, along with lowered authentication requirements for Terminal Services, the TAs can easily gain access to the compromised remote desktop. This access enables them to perform various actions on the victim's machine, such as:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Installing additional malware</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Exfiltrating sensitive data</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Monitoring user activity</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Modifying system settings</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Utilizing the machine for malicious activities</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Additionally, we observed an unwanted application—a hacking tool named ChromePass—associated with the same network infrastructure at “<em>hxxp://157.173.104[.]153/up/Tool/ChromePass.exe</em>” This tool is designed to steal saved passwords from Chromium-based browsers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Over the past year, this group has executed multiple attacks utilizing various lures and targeting different victims, all while remaining largely unnoticed. Their reliance on basic scripts has enabled TAs to gain remote access to compromised systems seamlessly, allowing for extensive exploitation without triggering alarms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Additionally, the deployment of the ChromePass tool further underscores the group’s intent to harvest sensitive information, such as saved passwords from Chromium-based browsers, thereby posing a significant threat to the security of individuals and organizations alike. This combination of tactics highlights the need for enhanced detection and prevention measures to combat these stealthy <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-are-cyber-threats/">cyber threats</a> effectively.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recommendations</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The initial breach may occur via spam emails. Therefore, it’s advisable to deploy strong email filtering systems to identify and prevent the dissemination of harmful attachments.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Exercise caution when handling email attachments or links, particularly those from unknown senders. Verify the sender’s identity, particularly if an email seems suspicious.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Consider disabling the execution of shortcut files (.lnk) from email attachments or implementing policies that require explicit user consent before executing such files.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Consider disabling or limiting the execution of scripting languages, such as PowerShell and cmd.exe, on user workstations and servers if they are not essential for legitimate purposes.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Implement policies that prevent the unauthorized creation of privileged accounts.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Regularly track changes to User Account Control (UAC)- related registry keys, such as “EnableLUA” and “ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin.” Monitoring these keys helps identify potential attempts to bypass UAC, enhancing system protection against unauthorized changes.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Strengthen the security of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by enforcing strong authentication mechanisms, such as <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-is-a-part-of-your-cyber-hygiene/">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA), and by using network-level authentication (NLA). Limiting RDP access to trusted IP addresses and utilizing VPNs can also help mitigate risks.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Set up network-level monitoring to detect unusual activities or data exfiltration by malware. Block suspicious activities to prevent potential breaches.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

This concern stems from the fact that Ublock Origin is heavily used and has been affected by these changes. However, it’s crucial to understand that these new rules don’t outright disable ad blockers, though they may impact some functionality.

The purpose of Manifest V3 is to enhance the security and privacy of Chrome extensions. A significant part of this is limiting remote code execution within extensions, a measure meant to prevent malicious activities that could lead to data breaches.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This stems from incidents like DataSpii, where extensions harvested sensitive user data including tax returns and financial information. Google’s Manifest V3 aims to prevent such vulnerabilities by introducing stricter regulations on the code that can be used within extensions.

For developers, this means adapting to new APIs, notably the WebRequest API, which has been altered to restrict certain network activities that extensions used to perform. While these changes are designed to increase user security, they require extension developers to modify how their tools work. Ad blockers like Ublock Origin can still function, but some users may need to manually enable or adjust settings to get them working effectively under Manifest V3.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Although many users believe that the update is intended to undermine ad blockers—especially since Google’s main revenue comes from ads—the truth is more nuanced. Google maintains that the changes are intended to bolster security, though skepticism remains high. Users are still able to use ad blockers such as Ublock Origin or switch to alternatives like Ublock Lite, which complies with the new regulations. Additionally, users can choose other browsers like Firefox that do not have the same restrictions and can still run extensions under their older, more flexible frameworks.

While Manifest V3 introduces hurdles, it doesn’t spell the end for ad blockers. The changes force developers to ensure that their tools follow stricter security protocols, but this could ultimately lead to safer browsing experiences.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If some extensions stop working, alternatives or updates are available to address the gaps. For now, users can continue to enjoy ad-free browsing with the right tools and settings, though they should remain vigilant in managing and updating their extensions.

To further protect themselves, users are advised to explore additional options such as using privacy-focused extensions like Privacy Badger or Ghostery. For more tech-savvy individuals, setting up hardware-based ad-blocking solutions like Pi-Hole can offer more comprehensive protection. A virtual private network (VPN) with built-in ad-blocking capabilities is another effective solution.

Ultimately, while Manifest V3 may introduce limitations, it’s far from the end of ad-blocking extensions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Developers are adapting, and users still have a variety of tools to block intrusive ads and enhance their browsing experience. Keeping ad blockers up to date and understanding how to manage extensions is key to ensuring a smooth transition into Google’s new extension framework.</div>

<title>AI hallucinations can pose a risk to your cybersecurity</title>
<link>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/ai-hallucinations-pose-risk-cybersecurity/</link>
<guid>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/ai-hallucinations-pose-risk-cybersecurity/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In early 2023, Google&rsquo;s Bard made headlines for a pretty big mistake, which we now call an AI hallucination. During a demo, the chatbot was asked, &ldquo;What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9-year-old about?&rdquo; Bard answered that JWST, which launched in December 2021, took the &ldquo;very first pictures&rdquo; of an exoplanet outside our solar system. However, the European Southern Observatory&rsquo;s Very Large Telescope took the first picture of an exoplanet in 2004.</p>
<h2>What is an AI hallucination?</h2>
<p>Simply put, an AI hallucination is when a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">large language model (LLM)</a>, such as a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">generative AI</a> tool, provides an answer that is incorrect. Sometimes, this means that the answer is totally fabricated, such as making up a research paper that doesn&rsquo;t exist. Other times, it&rsquo;s the wrong answer, such as with the Bard debacle.</p>
<p>Reasons for hallucination are varied, but the biggest one is that the data the model uses for training is incorrect &mdash; <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI</a> is only as accurate as the information it ingests. Input bias is also a top cause. If the data used for training contains biases, then the LLM will find patterns that are actually not there, which leads to incorrect results.</p>
<p>With businesses and consumers increasingly turning to AI for automation and decision-making, especially in key areas like healthcare and finance, the potential for errors poses a big risk. According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/cybersecurity/topics/cybersecurity-and-ai" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, AI hallucination compromises both decision-making and brand reputation. Additionally, AI hallucinations lead to the spreading of misinformation. Even more so, each AI hallucination leads to people not trusting AI results, which has widespread consequences, and businesses are increasingly turning to this technology.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s tempting to have blind trust in AI, it&rsquo;s important to use a balanced approach when using AI. By taking precautions to reduce AI hallucinations, organizations can weigh the benefits of AI with the potential complications, which include AI hallucinations.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://www.ibm.com/ai-cybersecurity">Explore AI cybersecurity solutions</a>
<h2>Organizations increasingly using generative AI for cybersecurity</h2>
<p>While the discussion about generative AI often focuses on software development, the issue increasingly affects <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a>. The reason is that organizations are starting to use generative AI for cybersecurity purposes.</p>
<p>Many cybersecurity professionals turn to generative AI for <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/3-recommendations-generative-ai-cyber-defense/">threat hunting.</a> While AI-powered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/siem" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security information and event management</a> (SIEM) improves response management, generative AI can use natural language searches for faster threat hunting. Analysts can use natural language chatbots to spot threats. Once a threat is detected, cybersecurity professionals can turn to generative AI to create a playbook based on the specific threat. Because generative AI uses training data to create the output, analysts have access to the latest information to respond to a specific threat with the best action.</p>
<p>Training is another common use for generative AI in cybersecurity. By using generative AI, cybersecurity professionals can use real-time data and current threats to create realistic scenarios. Through the simulation, cybersecurity teams get real-world experience and practice that was previously challenging to find. Because they can practice on similar threats to those they may encounter that day or week, professionals can train on current threats, not ones in the past.</p>
<h2>How AI hallucinations affect cybersecurity</h2>
<p>One of the biggest issues with AI hallucinations in cybersecurity is that the error can cause an organization to overlook a potential threat. For example, the AI tool may miss a potential threat that ends up causing a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cyberattack</a>. Often, this is due to bias in the model that happens through biased training data, which causes the tool to overlook a pattern that ends up affecting the results.</p>
<p>On the flip side, an AI hallucination may create a false alarm. If the generative AI tool fabricates a threat or falsely identifies a vulnerability, then employees will begin to trust the tool less in the future. Additionally, the organization focuses its resources on addressing the false threat, which means that a real attack may be overlooked. Each time that the AI tool produces inaccurate results, employee&rsquo;s confidence in the tool becomes lower, making it less likely that they will turn to AI or trust the results in the future.</p>
<p>Similarly, a hallucination can provide inaccurate recommendations that prolong detection or recovery. For example, a generative AI tool may accurately spot suspicious activity but provide inaccurate information on the next step or system recommendations. Because the IT team takes the wrong steps, the cyberattack is not stopped and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/threat-actor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">threat actors</a> gain access.</p>
<h2>Reducing the impact of AI hallucinations on cybersecurity</h2>
<p>By understanding and anticipating AI hallucinations, organizations can take proactive steps to both reduce the occurrence and the impact.</p>
<p>Here are three tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Train employees on prompt engineering. </strong>With generative AI, the quality of the results depends greatly on the specific prompts used for the requests. However, many employees create the prompts without formal training or knowledge on how to provide the right information to the model. Organizations that train their IT team on using specific and clear prompts can improve the results and possibly reduce AI hallucinations.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on data cleanliness. </strong>AI hallucinations often happen when using poisoned data, meaning there are errors or inaccuracies in the training data. For example, a model that is trained on data that includes cybersecurity threats that were later found to be false reports may identify a threat that is not accurate. By ensuring, as much as possible, that the model uses clean data then your organization can eliminate some AI hallucinations.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate fact-checking into your process. </strong>With today&rsquo;s current maturity level of generative AI tools, AI hallucinations are likely part of the process. Organizations should assume that errors or inaccurate information may be returned at this stage. By designing a fact-checking process to make sure that all information returned is accurate before employees take action, organizations can reduce the impact of the hallucinations on the business.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Leveling the cyber playing field</h2>
<p>Many ransomware gangs and cyber criminals are using generative AI to find vulnerabilities and create attacks. Organizations that use these same tools to fight cyber crime can put themselves on a more level playing field. By also taking proactive measures to prevent and reduce the impact of AI hallucinations, businesses can more successfully use generative AI to help their cybersecurity team better protect data and infrastructure.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Not long ago, the ability to digitally track someone’s daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a dangerous power that should remain only within the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69282" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69282" height="756" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69282">Image: Shutterstock, Arthimides.</p></div>
<p>Delaware-based<strong> Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</strong> helps its users remove their personal information from the clutches of consumer data brokers, and from <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=people+search" rel="noopener" target="_blank">people-search services online</a>. Backed by millions of dollars in litigation financing, Atlas so far this year has sued 151 consumer data brokers on behalf of a class that includes more than 20,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers who are signed up for Atlas services.</p>
<p>Atlas alleges all of these data brokers have ignored repeated warnings that they are violating <strong>Daniel’s Law</strong>, a New Jersey statute allowing law enforcement, government personnel, judges and their families to have their information completely removed from commercial data brokers. Daniel’s Law was passed in 2020 after the death of 20-year-old <strong>Daniel Anderl</strong>, who was killed in a violent attack targeting a federal judge &#8212; his mother.</p>
<p>Last week, Atlas invoked Daniel&#8217;s Law in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.18_Babel_Street_Compl_w_Summons-Case_Info_-_4874-8628-4017_-_1__1_.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a> (PDF) against <strong>Babel Street</strong>, a little-known technology company incorporated in Reston, Va. Babel Street&#8217;s core product allows customers to draw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slighted dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area.</p>
<p>Babel Street’s <strong>LocateX</strong> platform also allows customers to track individual mobile users by their <strong>Mobile Advertising ID</strong> or <strong>MAID</strong>, a unique, alphanumeric identifier built into all Google Android and Apple mobile devices.</p>
<p>Babel Street can offer this tracking capability by consuming location data and other identifying information that is collected by many websites and broadcast to dozens and sometimes hundreds of ad networks that may wish to bid on showing their ad to a particular user.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69280" style="width: 1458px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69280" height="990" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque.jpeg" width="1448" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69280">This image, taken from a video recording Atlas made of its private investigator using Babel Street to show all of the unique mobile IDs seen over time at a mosque in Dearborn, Michigan. Each red dot represents one mobile device.</p></div>
<p>In an interview, Atlas said a private investigator they hired was offered a free trial of Babel Street, which the investigator was able to use to determine the home address and daily movements of mobile devices belonging to multiple New Jersey police officers whose families have already faced significant harassment and death threats.</p>
<p>Atlas said the investigator encountered Babel Street while testing hundreds of data broker tools and services to see if personal information on its users was being sold. They soon discovered Babel Street also bundles people-search services with its platform, to make it easier for customers to zero in on a specific device.</p>
<p>The investigator contacted Babel Street about possibly buying home addresses in certain areas of New Jersey. After listening to a sales pitch for Babel Street and expressing interest, the investigator was told Babel Street only offers their service to the government or to “contractors of the government.”</p>
<p>“The investigator (truthfully) mentioned that he was contemplating some government contract work in the future and was told by the Babel Street salesperson that ‘that’s good enough’ and that ‘they don’t actually check,’” Atlas shared in an email with reporters.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was one of five media outlets invited to review screen recordings that Atlas made while its investigator used a two-week trial version of Babel Street’s LocateX service. References and links to reporting by other publications, including <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-u-s-government-bought-tool-that-can-track-phones-at-abortion-clinics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>404 Media</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/security/2024-10-23/ty-article-magazine/.premium/00000192-b90c-dc97-a593-f96f50800000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Haaretz</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.notus.org/technology/cell-phone-tracking-law-enforcement-abortion-clinic" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>NOTUS</strong></a>, and <strong>The New York Times</strong>, will appear throughout this story.</p>
<p>Collectively, these stories expose how the broad availability of mobile advertising data has created a market in which virtually anyone can build a sophisticated spying apparatus capable of tracking the daily movements of hundreds of millions of people globally.</p>
<p>The findings outlined in Atlas&#8217;s lawsuit against Babel Street also illustrate how mobile location data is set to massively complicate several hot-button issues, from the tracking of suspected illegal immigrants or women seeking abortions, to harassing public servants who are already in the crosshairs over baseless conspiracy theories and increasingly hostile political rhetoric against government employees.</p>
<h2>WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE</h2>
<p>Atlas says the Babel Street trial period allowed its investigator to find information about visitors to high-risk targets such as mosques, synagogues, courtrooms and abortion clinics. In one video, an Atlas investigator showed how they isolated mobile devices seen in a New Jersey courtroom parking lot that was reserved for jurors, and then tracked one likely juror’s phone to their home address over several days.</p>
<p>While the Atlas investigator had access to its trial account at Babel Street, they were able to successfully track devices belonging to several plaintiffs named or referenced in the lawsuit. They did so by drawing a digital polygon around the home address or workplace of each person in Babel Street’s platform, which focused exclusively on the devices that passed through those addresses each day.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69273" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69273" height="648" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69273">Each red dot in this Babel Street map represents a unique mobile device that has been seen since April 2022 at a Jewish synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif. Image: Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</p></div>
<p>One unique feature of Babel Street is the ability to toggle a “night” mode, which makes it relatively easy to determine within a few meters where a target typically lays their head each night (because their phone is usually not far away).</p>
<p>Atlas plaintiffs <strong>Scott</strong> and <strong>Justyna Maloney</strong> are both veteran officers with the Rahway, NJ police department who live together with their two young children. In April 2023, Scott and Justyna became the target of intense harassment and death threats after Officer Justyna responded to a routine call about a man filming people outside of the Motor Vehicle Commission in Rahway.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEZWtC9bdI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">man filming</a> the Motor Vehicle Commission that day is a social media personality who often solicits police contact and then records himself arguing about constitutional rights with the responding officers.</p>
<p>Officer Justyna’s interaction with the man was entirely peaceful, and the episode appeared to end without incident. But after a selectively edited video of that encounter went viral, their home address and unpublished phone numbers were posted online. When their tormentors figured out that Scott was also a cop (a sergeant), the couple began receiving dozens of threatening text messages, including specific death threats.</p>
<p>According to the Atlas lawsuit, one of the messages to Mr. Maloney demanded money, and warned that his family would &#8220;pay in blood&#8221; if he didn’t comply. Sgt. Maloney said he then received a video in which a masked individual pointed a rifle at the camera and told him that his family was &#8220;going to get [their] heads cut off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maloney said a few weeks later, one of their neighbors saw two suspicious individuals in ski masks parked one block away from the home and alerted police. Atlas’s complaint says video surveillance from neighboring homes shows the masked individuals circling the Maloney’s home. The responding officers arrested two men, who were armed, for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69289" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69289" height="437" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69289">According to Google Maps, Babel Street shares a corporate address with Google and the consumer credit reporting bureau TransUnion.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said their investigator was not able to conclusively find Scott Maloney’s iPhone in the Babel Street platform, but they did find Justyna’s. Babel Street had nearly 100,000 hits for her phone over several months, allowing Atlas to piece together an intimate picture of Justyna’s daily movements and meetings with others.<span id="more-69216"></span></p>
<p>An Atlas investigator visited the Maloneys and inspected Justyna’s iPhone, and determined the only app that used her device’s location data was from the department store <strong>Macy’s</strong>.</p>
<p>In a written response to questions, Macy&#8217;s said its app includes an opt-in feature for geo-location, &#8220;which allows customers to receive an enhanced shopping experience based on their location.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not store any customer location information,&#8221; Macy&#8217;s wrote. &#8220;We share geo-location data with a <a href="https://www.macys.com/ads.txt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limited number of partners</a> who help us deliver this enhanced app experience. Furthermore, we have no connection with Babel Street&#8221; [link added for context].</p>
<p>Justyna’s experience highlights a stark reality about the broad availability of mobile location data: Even if the person you’re looking for isn’t directly identifiable in platforms like Babel Street, it is likely that at least some of that person’s family members are. In other words, it’s often trivial to infer the location of one device by successfully locating another.</p>
<p>The terms of service for Babel Street’s Locate X service state that the product &#8220;may not be used as the basis for any legal process in any country, including as the basis for a warrant, subpoena, or any other legal or administrative action.&#8221; But Scott Maloney said he’s convinced by their experience that not even law enforcement agencies should have access to this capability without a warrant.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a law enforcement officer, in order for me to track someone I need a judge to sign a warrant &#8211; and that&#8217;s for a criminal investigation after we&#8217;ve developed probable cause,&#8221; Mr. Maloney said in an interview. &#8220;Data brokers tracking me and my family just to sell that information for profit, without our consent, and even after we&#8217;ve explicitly asked them not to is deeply disturbing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Maloney’s law enforcement colleagues in other states may see things differently. In August, <strong>The Texas Observer</strong> <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-dps-surveillance-tangle-cobwebs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that state police plan to spend more than $5 million on a contract for a controversial surveillance tool called <strong>Tangles</strong> from the tech firm PenLink. Tangles is an AI-based web platform that scrapes information from the open, deep and dark web, and it has a premier feature called <strong>WebLoc</strong> that can be used to geofence mobile devices.</p>
<p>The <strong>Associated Press</strong> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27ef" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported last month</a> that law enforcement agencies from suburban Southern California to rural North Carolina have been using an obscure cell phone tracking tool called <strong>Fog Reveal</strong> — at times without warrants — that gives them the ability to follow people’s movements going back many months.</p>
<p>It remains unclear precisely how Babel Street is obtaining the abundance of mobile location data made available to users of its platform. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>But according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2020-HQFO-01656.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a document</a> (PDF) obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Science and Technology directorate, Babel Street re-hosts data from the commercial phone tracking firm <strong>Venntel</strong>.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Substack newsletter <strong>All-Source Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_29FTC124C0060_2900_-NONE-_-NONE-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unearthed documents</a> indicating that the <strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</strong> has opened an inquiry into Venntel and its parent company Gravy Analytics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Venntel has also been a data partner of the police surveillance contractor Fog Data Science, whose product has been described as ‘mass surveillance on a budget,'&#8221; All-Source&#8217;s <strong>Jack Poulson</strong> <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/ftc-opened-investigation-into-commercial" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;Venntel was also reported to have been a primary data source of the controversial ‘Locate X’ phone tracking product of the American data fusion company Babel Street.&#8221;</p>
<h2>MAID IN HELL</h2>
<p>The Mobile Advertising ID or MAID — the unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each mobile device — was originally envisioned as a way to distinguish individual mobile customers without relying on personally identifiable information such as phone numbers or email addresses.</p>
<p>However, there is now <a href="https://datarade.ai/data-categories/device-graph-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a robust industry</a> of marketing and advertising companies that specialize in assembling enormous lists of MAIDs that are &#8220;enriched&#8221; with historical and personal information about the individual behind each MAID.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69270" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69270" height="411" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69270">One of many vendors that &#8220;enrich&#8221; MAID data with other identifying information, including name, address, email address and phone number.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said its investigator wanted to know whether they could find enriched MAID records on their New Jersey law enforcement customers, and soon found plenty of ad data brokers willing to sell it.</p>
<p>Some vendors offered only a handful of data fields, such as first and last name, MAID and email address. Other brokers sold far more detailed histories along with their MAID, including each subject’s social media profiles, precise GPS coordinates, and even likely consumer category.</p>
<p>How are advertisers and data brokers gaining access to so much information? Some sources of MAID data can be apps on your phone such as <strong>AccuWeather</strong>, <strong>GasBuddy</strong>, <strong>Grindr</strong>, and <strong>MyFitnessPal</strong> that collect your MAID and location and sell that to brokers.</p>
<p>A user&#8217;s MAID profile and location data also is commonly shared as a consequence of simply using a smartphone to visit a web page that features ads. In the few milliseconds before those ads load, the website will send a &#8220;<strong>bid request</strong>&#8221; to various ad exchanges, where advertisers can bid on the chance to place their ad in front of users who match the consumer profiles they’re seeking. A great deal of data can be included in a bid request, including the user&#8217;s precise location (the current open standard for bid requests is detailed <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>The trouble is that virtually anyone can access the &#8220;bidstream&#8221; data flowing through these so-called &#8220;<strong>realtime bidding</strong>&#8221; networks, because the information is simultaneously broadcast in the clear to hundreds of entities around the world.</p>
<p>The result is that there are a number of marketing companies that now enrich and broker access to this mobile location information. Earlier this year, the German news outlet <strong>netzpolitik.org</strong> purchased a bidstream data set containing more than 3.6 billion data points, and shared the information with the German daily <strong>BR24</strong>. They concluded that the data they obtained (through a free trial, no less) made it possible to establish movement profiles — some of them quite precise — of <a href="https://interaktiv.br.de/ausspioniert-mit-standortdaten/en/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">several million people across Germany</a>.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69268" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69268" height="492" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/br24-netzpolitik.png" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69268">A screenshot from the BR24/Netzpolitik story about their ability to track millions of Germans, including many employees of the German Federal Police and Interior Ministry.</p></div>
<p><strong>Politico</strong> recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/23/tk-alfred-top-00180521" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered</a> startling <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941708" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research</a> from universities in New Hampshire, Kentucky and St. Louis that showed how the mobile advertising data they acquired allowed them to link visits from investigators with the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) to insiders selling stock before the investigations became public knowledge.</p>
<p>The researchers in that study said they didn&#8217;t attempt to use the same methods to track regulators from other agencies, but that virtually anyone could do it.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Sherman</strong>, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law&#8217;s Center for Privacy and Technology, called the research a &#8220;shocking demonstration of what happens when companies can freely harvest Americans’ geolocation data and sell it for their chosen price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Politicians should understand how they, their staff, and public servants are threatened by the sale of personal data—and constituent groups should realize that talk of data broker &#8216;controls&#8217; or &#8216;best practices&#8221; is designed by companies to distract from the underlying problems and the comprehensive privacy and security solutions, Sherman <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/data-brokers-and-threats-to-government-employees" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote for Lawfare this week</a>.</p>
<h2>A BIDSTREAM DRAGNET?</h2>
<p>The Orwellian nature of modern mobile advertising networks may soon have far-reaching implications for women’s reproductive rights, as more states move to outlaw abortion within their borders. The 2022 Dobbs decision by the U.S. Supreme Court discarded the federal right to abortion, and 14 states have since enacted strict abortion bans.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups are already using mobile advertising data to advance their cause. In May 2023, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/IZenH" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that an anti-abortion group in Wisconsin used precise geolocation data to direct ads to women it suspected of seeking abortions.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is little to stop antiabortion groups from purchasing bidstream data (or renting access to a platform like Babel Street) and using it to geofence abortion clinics, potentially revealing all mobile devices transiting through these locations.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator geofenced an abortion clinic and was able to identify a likely employee at that clinic, following their daily route to and from that individual&#8217;s home address.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69272" style="width: 1610px;"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-69272 size-full" height="1195" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" width="1600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69272">A still shot from a video Atlas shared of its use of Babel Street to identify and track an employee traveling each day between their home and the clinic.</p></div>
<p>Last year, Idaho became the first state to outlaw &#8220;abortion trafficking,&#8221; which the <strong>Idaho Capital Sun</strong> <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/26/helping-a-minor-travel-for-an-abortion-some-states-have-made-it-a-crime/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> is defined as &#8220;recruiting, harboring or transporting a pregnant minor to get an abortion or abortion medication without parental permission.&#8221; Tennessee now has a similar law, and GOP lawmakers in five other states introduced abortion trafficking bills that failed to advance this year, the Sun reports.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator used Babel Street to identify and track a person traveling from their home in Alabama &#8212; where abortion is now illegal &#8212; to an abortion clinic just over the border in Tallahassee, Fla. &#8212; and back home again within a few hours. Abortion rights advocates and providers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/nx-s1-5082217/can-alabama-prosecute-someone-for-helping-people-travel-out-of-state-for-an-abortion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are currently suing Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall</a>, seeking to block him from prosecuting people who help patients travel out-of-state to end pregnancies.</p>
<p><strong>Eva Galperin</strong>, director of cybersecurity at the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation </strong>(EFF), a non-profit digital rights group, said she’s extremely concerned about dragnet surveillance of people crossing state lines in order to get abortions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Specifically, Republican officials from states that have outlawed abortion have made it clear that they are interested in targeting people who have gone to neighboring states in order to get abortions, and to make it more difficult for people who are seeking abortions to go to neighboring states,&#8221; Galperin said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a great leap to imagine that states will do this.&#8221;</p>
<h2>APPLES AND GOOGLES</h2>
<p>Atlas found that for the right price (typically $10-50k a year), brokers can provide access to tens of billions of data points covering large swaths of the US population and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Based on the data sets Atlas acquired — many of which included older MAID records — they estimate they could locate roughly 80 percent of Android-based devices, and about 25 percent of Apple phones. Google refers to its MAID as the &#8220;<strong>Android Advertising ID</strong>,&#8221; (AAID) while Apple calls it the &#8220;<strong>Identifier for Advertisers</strong>&#8221; (IDFA).</p>
<p>What accounts for the disparity between the number of Android and Apple devices that can be found in mobile advertising data? In April 2021, Apple shipped version 14.5 of its iOS operating system, which introduced a technology called <strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong> (ATT) that requires apps to get affirmative consent before they can track users by their IDFA or any other identifier.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s introduction of ATT had a swift and profound impact on the advertising market: Less than a year later Facebook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that the iPhone privacy feature would decrease the company’s 2022 revenues by about $10 billion.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69274" style="width: 890px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69274" height="324" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png" width="880" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69274">Source: cnbc.com.</p></div>
<p>Google runs by far the world&#8217;s largest ad exchange, known as <strong>AdX</strong>. The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/technology/google-ad-antitrust-trial-arguments.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accused Google of building a monopoly</a> over the technology that places ads on websites, estimates that Google&#8217;s ad exchange controls 47 percent of the U.S. market and 56 percent globally.</p>
<p>According to recent figures, Google&#8217;s <strong>Android</strong> is also the dominant mobile operating system worldwide, with more than 72 percent of the market. In the U.S., however, iPhone users claim approximately 55 percent of the market, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ios-vs-android-market-share/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TechRepublic</a>.</p>
<p>In response to requests for comment, Google said it does not send real time bidding requests to Babel Street, nor does it share precise location data in bid requests. The company added that its policies explicitly prohibit the sale of data from real-time bidding, or its use for any purpose other than advertising.</p>
<p>Google said its MAIDs are randomly generated and do not contain IP addresses, GPS coordinates, or any other location data, and that its ad systems do not share anyone’s precise location data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Android has clear controls for users to manage app access to device location, and reset or delete their advertising ID,&#8221; Google’s written statement reads. &#8220;If we learn that someone, whether an app developer, ad tech company or anyone else, is violating our policies, we take appropriate action. Beyond that, we support legislation and industry collaboration to address these types of data practices that negatively affect the entire mobile ecosystem, including all operating systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a written statement shared with reporters, Apple said Location Services is not on by default in its devices. Rather, users must enable Location Services and must give permission to each app or website to use location data. Users can turn Location Services off at any time, and can change whether apps have access to location at any time. The user&#8217;s choices include precise vs. approximate location, as well as a one-time grant of location access by the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and build privacy protections into each of our products and services to put the user in control of their data,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said. &#8220;We minimize personal data collection, and where possible, process data only on users’ devices.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Zach Edwards</strong> is a senior threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm <strong>SilentPush</strong> who has studied the location data industry closely. Edwards said Google and Apple can&#8217;t keep pretending like the MAIDs being broadcast into the bidstream from hundreds of millions of American devices aren’t making most people trivially trackable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The privacy risks here will remain until Apple and Google permanently turn off their mobile advertising ID schemes and admit to the American public that this is the technology that has been supporting the global data broker ecosystem,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>STATES ACT, WHILE CONGRESS DITHERS</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Bloomberg Law</strong>, between 2019 and 2023, threats against federal judges have more than doubled. Amid increasingly hostile political rhetoric and conspiracy theories against government officials, a growing number of states are <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/cops-battle-data-brokers-for-privacy-in-constitutional-clash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seeking to pass their own versions of Daniel’s Law</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, a retired <strong>West Virginia</strong> police officer <a href="https://therecord.media/west-virginia-law-enforcement-sues-broker" rel="noopener" target="_blank">filed a class action lawsuit</a> against the people-search service Whitepages for listing their personal information in violation of a statute the state passed in 2021 that largely mirrors Daniel’s Law.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Maryland passed the <strong>Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act</strong> — named after a county circuit court judge who was murdered by an individual involved in a divorce proceeding over which he was presiding. The law allows current and former members of the Maryland judiciary to request their personal information not be made available to the public.</p>
<p>Under the Maryland law, personal information can include a home address; telephone number, email address; Social Security number or federal tax ID number; bank account or payment card number; a license plate or other unique vehicle identifier; a birth or marital record; a child’s name, school, or daycare; place of worship; place of employment for a spouse, child, or dependent.</p>
<p>The law firm <strong>Troutman Pepper</strong> <a href="https://www.troutman.com/insights/maryland-enacts-the-judge-andrew-f-wilkinson-judicial-security-act-are-more-daniels-laws-on-the-horizon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">writes</a> that &#8220;so far in 2024, 37 states have begun considering or have adopted similar privacy-based legislation designed to protect members of the judiciary and, in some states, other government officials involved in law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Atlas alleges that in response to requests to have data on its New Jersey law enforcement clients scrubbed from consumer records sold by <strong>LexisNexis</strong>, the data broker retaliated by freezing the credit of approximately 18,500 people, and falsely reporting them as identity theft victims.</p>
<p>In addition, Atlas said LexisNexis started returning failure codes indicating they had no record of these individuals, resulting in denials when officers attempted to refinance loans or open new bank accounts.</p>
<p>The data broker industry has responded by having at least 70 of the Atlas lawsuits moved to federal court, and challenging the constitutionality of the New Jersey statute as overly broad and a violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the data broker industry argued in their motion to dismiss that there is “no First Amendment doctrine that exempts a content-based restriction from strict scrutiny just because it has some nexus with a privacy interest.”</p>
<p>Atlas&#8217;s lawyers responded that data covered under Daniel&#8217;s Law &#8212; personal information of New Jersey law enforcement officers &#8212; is not free speech. Atlas notes that while defending against comparable lawsuits, the data broker industry has argued that home address and phone number data are not &#8220;communications.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Data brokers should not be allowed to argue that information like addresses are not &#8216;communications&#8217; in one context, only to turn around and claim that addresses are protectable communications,&#8221; Atlas <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/5.-PLAINTIFFS-MEMORANDUM-OF-LAW-IN-OPPOSITION-TO-DEFENDANTS-CONSOLIDATED-MOTION-TO-DISMISS-PLAINTIFFS-COMPLAINT.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">argued</a> (PDF). &#8220;Nor can their change of course alter the reality that the data at issue is not speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge overseeing the challenge is expected to rule on the motion to dismiss within the next few weeks. Regardless of the outcome, the decision is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, media law experts say they’re concerned that enacting Daniel’s Law in other states could limit the ability of journalists to hold public officials accountable, and allow authorities <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/09/21/judge-declines-to-limit-daniels-law-for-reporters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to pursue criminal charges against media outlets</a> that publish the same type of public and government records that fuel the people-search industry.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.) said Congress&#8217; failure to regulate data brokers, and the administration&#8217;s continued opposition to bipartisan legislation that would limit data sales to law enforcement, have created this current privacy crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether location data is being used to identify and expose closeted gay Americans, or to track people as they cross state lines to seek reproductive health care, data brokers are selling Americans&#8217; deepest secrets and exposing them to serious harm, all for a few bucks,” Wyden said in a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, 404 Media, Haaretz, NOTUS, and The New York Times.</p>
<p>Sen. Wyden said Google also deserves blame for refusing to follow Apple&#8217;s lead by removing companies&#8217; ability to track phones.</p>
<p>“Google&#8217;s insistence on uniquely tracking Android users &#8211; and allowing ad companies to do so as well &#8211; has created the technical foundations for the surveillance economy and the abuses stemming from it,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>Georgetown Law&#8217;s Justin Sherman said the data broker and mobile ad industries claim there are protections in place to anonymize mobile location data and restrict access to it, and that there are limits to the kinds of invasive inferences one can make from location data. The data broker industry also likes to tout the usefulness of mobile location data in fighting retail fraud, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All kinds of things can be inferred from this data, including people being targeted by abusers, or people with a particular health condition or religious belief,&#8221; Sherman said. &#8220;You can track jurors, law enforcement officers visiting the homes of suspects, or military intelligence people meeting with their contacts. The notion that the sale of all this data is preventing harm and fraud is hilarious in light of all the harm it causes enabling people to better target their cyber operations, or learning about people&#8217;s extramarital affairs and extorting public officials.&#8221;</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>Privacy experts say disabling or deleting your device&#8217;s MAID will have no effect on how your phone operates, except that you may begin to see far less targeted ads on that device.</p>
<p>Any Android apps with permission to use your location should appear when you navigate to the Settings app, Location, and then App Permissions. &#8220;Allowed all the time&#8221; is the most permissive setting, followed by &#8220;Allowed only while in use,&#8221; &#8220;Ask every time,&#8221; and &#8220;Not allowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Android users can delete their ad ID permanently, by opening the Settings app and navigating to Privacy &gt; Ads. Tap &#8220;Delete advertising ID,&#8221; then tap it again on the next page to confirm. According to the EFF, this will prevent any app on your phone from accessing the ad ID in the future.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69276" style="width: 660px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69276" height="589" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/android-ads-optout.png" width="650" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69276">Image: eff.org</p></div>
<p>By default, Apple&#8217;s iOS requires apps to ask permission before they can access your device&#8217;s IDFA. When you install a new app, it may ask for permission to track you. When prompted to do so by an app, select the &#8220;Ask App Not to Track&#8221; option. Apple users also can set the &#8220;Allow apps to request to track&#8221; switch to the &#8220;off&#8221; position, which will block apps from asking to track you.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69278" style="width: 585px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69278" height="390" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/applerequesttotrack.png" width="575" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69278">Apple&#8217;s Privacy and Ad Tracking Settings.</p></div>
<p>Apple also has its own targeted advertising system which is separate from third-party tracking enabled by the IDFA. To disable it, go to Settings, Privacy, and Apple Advertising, and ensure that the &#8220;Personalized Ads&#8221; setting is set to &#8220;off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re the type of reader who&#8217;s the default IT support person for a small group of family or friends (bless your heart), it would be a good idea to set their devices not to track them, and to disable any apps that may have location data sharing turned on 24/7.</p>
<p>There is a dual benefit to this altruism, which is clearly in the device owner&#8217;s best interests. Because while <em>your</em> device may not be directly trackable via advertising data, making sure they&#8217;re opted out of said tracking also can reduce the likelihood that you are trackable simply by being physically close to those who <em>are</em>.</p>

<title>5 new protections on Google Messages to help keep you safe</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Jan Jedrzejowicz, Director of Product, Android and Business Communications; Alberto Pastor Nieto, Sr. Product Manager Google Messages and RCS Spam and Abuse; Stephan Somogyi, Product Lead, User Protection; Branden Archer, Software Engineer</span>

<p>
Every day, over a billion people use <a href="http://messages.google.com">Google Messages</a> to communicate. That’s why we’ve made security a top priority, building in powerful on-device, AI-powered filters and advanced security that protects users from 2 billion suspicious messages a month. With end-to-end encrypted<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> RCS conversations, you can communicate privately with other Google Messages RCS users. And we’re not stopping there. We're committed to constantly developing new controls and features to make your conversations on Google Messages even more secure and private.
</p>
<p>
<strong>As part of cybersecurity awareness month, we're sharing five new protections to help keep you safe while using Google Messages on Android:</strong>
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Enhanced detection protects you from package delivery and job scams. </strong> Google Messages is adding new protections against scam texts that may seem harmless at first but can eventually lead to fraud. For <a href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/9131090?hl=en#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20beta%20testing,Follow%20the%20instructions.">Google Messages beta users</a><sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, we’re rolling out enhanced scam detection, with improved analysis of scammy texts, starting with a focus on package delivery and job seeking messages. When Google Messages suspects a potential scam text, it will automatically move the message into your spam folder or warn you. Google Messages uses on-device machine learning models to classify these scams, so your conversations stay private and the content is never sent to Google unless you report spam. We’re rolling this enhancement out now to Google Messages beta users who have spam protection enabled.</li>

<li><strong>Intelligent warnings alert you about potentially dangerous links</strong>. In the past year, we’ve been piloting more protections for Google Messages users when they receive text messages with potentially dangerous links. In India, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, Google Messages warns users when they get a link from unknown senders and blocks messages with links from suspicious senders. We’re in the process of expanding this feature globally later this year.</li>

<li><strong>Controls to turn off messages from unknown international senders</strong>. In some cases, scam text messages come from international numbers. Soon, you will be able to automatically hide messages from international senders who are not existing contacts so you don’t have to interact with them. If enabled, messages from international non-contacts will automatically be moved to the “Spam & blocked” folder. This feature will <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/google-pilot-new-android-anti-scam-features-block-sms-play-protect-4682046?cid=telegram_cna_social_28112017_cna">roll out first as a pilot in Singapore</a> later this year before we look at expanding to more countries.</li>

<li><strong>Sensitive Content Warnings give you control over seeing and sending images that may contain nudity. </strong>At Google, we aim to provide users with <a href="https://safety.google/content-safety/?_gl=1*1qxnom0*_up*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjNS3BhChARIsAOxBM6qmnJ7G3JputxEJU-vd2Z8iW6YaLITy6xrXeDhK6TpCv7wEDf64JdAaAmaOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">a variety of ways to protect themselves against unwanted content</a>, while keeping them in control of their data. This is why we’re introducing Sensitive Content Warnings for Google Messages.<br /><br />Sensitive Content Warnings is an optional feature that blurs images that may contain nudity before viewing, and then prompts with a “speed bump” that contains help-finding resources and options, including to view the content. When the feature is enabled, and an image that may contain nudity is about to be sent or forwarded, it also provides a speed bump to remind users of the risks of sending nude imagery and preventing accidental shares.<br /><br />All of this happens on-device to protect your privacy and keep end-to-end encrypted message content private to only sender and recipient. Sensitive Content Warnings doesn’t allow Google access to the contents of your images, nor does Google know that nudity may have been detected. This feature is opt-in for adults, managed via Android Settings, and is opt-out for users under 18 years of age. Sensitive Content Warnings will be rolling out to Android 9+ devices including Android Go devices<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> with Google Messages in the coming months.</li>

<li><strong>More confirmation about who you’re messaging. </strong>To help you avoid sophisticated messaging threats where an attacker tries to impersonate one of your contacts, we’re working to add a contact verifying feature to Android. This new feature will allow you to verify your contacts' public keys so you can confirm you’re communicating with the person you intend to message. We’re creating a unified system for public key verification across different apps, which you can verify through QR code scanning or number comparison. This feature will be launching next year for Android 9+ devices, with support for messaging apps including Google Messages.
<p>
These are just some of the new and upcoming features that you can use to better protect yourself when sending and receiving messages. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging">Download Google Messages</a> from the Google Play Store to enjoy these protections and controls and learn more about Google Messages <a href="https://www.android.com/google-messages/">here</a>.

<title>HM Surf Bug in macOS Raises Data Privacy Concerns</title>
<link>https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/10/hm-surf-bug-in-macos-raises-data.html</link>
<guid>https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/10/hm-surf-bug-in-macos-raises-data.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZbywA8qayZtyi7djUM2WX-it_cO9j_1E_iavz-5FlvKPwx5_5MlV-jIBrRSHsTgamM9rFsXjVrr0EC4ZiDS81gOY3CFXc__SltZQlqH413AYOFnguAyFQLFWaEWwzrAK_kHNjR3_A2jCWXKqB2W1VdJvWOl5rjQ4B3UGR2DgNnQt3-_EKrm10s2IxjFiI/s4857/pexels-abdullah-bin-mubarak-2067629-3693732.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZbywA8qayZtyi7djUM2WX-it_cO9j_1E_iavz-5FlvKPwx5_5MlV-jIBrRSHsTgamM9rFsXjVrr0EC4ZiDS81gOY3CFXc__SltZQlqH413AYOFnguAyFQLFWaEWwzrAK_kHNjR3_A2jCWXKqB2W1VdJvWOl5rjQ4B3UGR2DgNnQt3-_EKrm10s2IxjFiI/w640-h426/pexels-abdullah-bin-mubarak-2067629-3693732.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">Several vulnerabilities in the Safari web browser for macOS may have left users open to being spied on, having their data stolen, and acquiring other types of malware thanks to this security weakness.

Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the special permissions Apple gives to its proprietary apps, and here, it is the browser, as well as the ease with which an attacker can obtain the important configuration files of an app.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, what it allows a user to do is to circumvent the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) security layer on MacBooks that is designed to safeguard sensitive data from an attacker. CVE-2024-44133 has been rated as a "medium" severity vulnerability by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), meaning that it has a 5.5 severity score as per the CVSS.

According to the CVE-2024-44133 vulnerability report, attackers can bypass the user data protection methods implemented by the operating system by bypassing Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC).&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the September 16 update for Mac Studio (2022 and later), iMac (2019 and later), Mac Pro (2019 and later), Mac Mini (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2020 and later), MacBook Pro (2018 and later), and iMac Pro (2017 and later), the vulnerability, also referred to as CVE-2024-44133, had been fixed.

Please take note that this vulnerability will only impact devices that are managed by Mobile Device Management (MDM), not any other device. Typically, MDM managed devices are subject to policies and procedures set by the IT department of an organization, which is responsible for centrally managing and maintaining the devices.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Microsoft, the flaw has been named "HM Surf." By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker would be able to bypass macOS' Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) features and gain unauthorized access to a user's protected data, which they would have no control over.

There is a possibility users may discover Safari's TCC in action while browsing a website that requires access to the camera or microphone when browsing through the website.

It was noted by Apple in mid-September that a bug in macOS Sequoia 15 has been fixed by removing the vulnerable code. However, the bug does not seem to affect MDM-managed devices.

As stated in the blog post, Microsoft’s Sequoia 15 release only protects Apple’s Safari web browser when it is installed.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was also pointed out that browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox don't have the same private entitlements as Apple applications, so they cannot bypass TCC checks like Apple applications can. Therefore, once TCC checks are approved, it is up to the app to maintain access to the privacy database as long as people have approved the checks.

This vulnerability can be exploited by removing the TCC protection for the Safari browser directory and editing a configuration file in that directory. It is stated in Microsoft's response that it involves gaining access to the user's data, such as browsed pages, the camera, microphone, and location of the device, without the user's knowledge.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Users of macOS are strongly encouraged to apply these security updates as soon as possible so that their system will be protected. Using its behavior monitoring capabilities, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has detected activities associated with Adload, one of the most prevalent macOS threat families, which may be exploiting this vulnerability in some way. In addition to detecting and blocking CVE-2024-44133 exploitation, Windows Defender for Endpoint also detects and blocks anomalous modifications of the Preferences file through HM Surf or other mechanisms that potentially exploit the vulnerability.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Microsoft, it was TCC technology that first enabled them to learn how to bypass the technology when they discovered powerdir's vulnerability. Please remember that TCC, as its name implies, is a technology that prevents apps from accessing users' personal information when they are installed and that this includes services such as location services, camera and microphone devices, download directories, and others, without the user's knowledge or consent.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the world of mobile applications, the only legal way for them to gain access to these services is by approving a popup through their user interface, or if they approve per-app access via the settings in their operating system. 

This vulnerability, known as HM-Surf, may allow attackers to bypass key security features on macOS systems, which gives them a chance to gain access to sensitive data through the use of malicious code. It is possible that users who are not authorized to exploit the flaw could exploit macOS' own security functions, such as the sandboxing mechanisms and restrictions on file access.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">HM-Surf exploit is a vulnerability that allows attackers to gain enhanced privileges, which allows them to access sensitive data and files that would otherwise require a login and password.

Initial warnings were raised about this vulnerability because it played a role in adware campaigns, where malicious actors used this loophole to install unwanted software on users' devices in order to profit from the vulnerability. There are, however, a lot more dangers than just adware; though, it is only the beginning. If the same vulnerability were weaponized, then it might even be used for more serious attacks, such as data exfiltration, surveillance, or even as a gateway to further malware infiltration in the near future.

There is probably no doubt that HM-Surf's unique ability to bypass Apple's robust security architecture is one of the most troubling aspects of this malware.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Security

macOS is widely regarded as a secure platform, but the recent discovery of the HM-Surf vulnerability shows that even advanced systems are not immune to evolving cyber threats. This finding serves as a crucial reminder for users and organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and adopt proactive measures to protect their digital environments.

Microsoft's cybersecurity team uncovered HM-Surf, an exploit posing a serious risk to macOS. Their investigation revealed a program altering Google Chrome settings to grant unauthorized microphone and camera access while collecting user and device data.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">These actions suggested preparations for a second-stage payload that could further compromise the device.

The culprit was identified as the well-known macOS adware "AdLoad." This malware hijacks browser traffic, inundates users with ads, harvests data, and transforms infected devices into botnet nodes for further malicious activity. Although Microsoft's findings aligned with HM-Surf techniques, the researchers could not conclusively link AdLoad to actively exploiting the vulnerability.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, they warned that "attackers using a similar method to deploy a prevalent threat" underscored the need for enhanced protection.

The HM-Surf vulnerability illustrates the risks associated with macOS, highlighting that no operating system is invulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Exploiting such weaknesses could lead to severe consequences, including financial losses, reputational damage, and the exposure of sensitive data. The evolving nature of these threats suggests that attackers are continuously refining their methods to bypass security measures.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">To address these challenges, organizations must adopt a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. This includes regular system updates, comprehensive monitoring, and user education on safe practices. Deploying advanced threat detection and real-time monitoring can help detect and mitigate attacks before they cause significant harm. Regular security assessments can also identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

In summary, the emergence of the HM-Surf vulnerability is a stark reminder of the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity threats. For macOS users and businesses, this discovery emphasizes the need to act swiftly in strengthening defenses and protecting digital assets against evolving risks.</div>

There is no doubt that the movie focuses on data and privacy, but humans are social animals and they need someone to listen to them, guide them, or be there as they go through life.&nbsp;

The CEO of Microsoft AI, Mustafa Suleyman, spoke about this recently in a CNBC interview.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During an interview with CNN, Suleyman explained that the company is engineering AI companions to watch "what we are doing and to remember what we are doing." This will create a close relationship between AI and humans.

As a result of the announcement of AI assistants for the workplace, many companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google have come up with such solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It has been announced by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that Windows will be launching a new feature called Recall. A semantic search is more than just a keyword search; it digs deep into users' digital history to recreate moments from the past, tracking them back to the time they happened.

It was announced today by Microsoft's AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, that Copilot, the company's artificial intelligence assistant, has been redesigned.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Copilot, a newly revamped version of Microsoft's most popular AI companion, shares the same vision of a companion for AI that will revolutionize the way users interact with technology daily in their day-to-day lives with the AI head.
After joining Microsoft earlier this year, after the company strategically hired key staff from Inflection AI, Suleyman wrote a 700-word memo describing what he refers to as a "technological paradigm shift."&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Copilot has been redesigned to create an AI experience that is more personalized and supportive, similar to Inflection AI's Pi product, which adapts to users' requirements over time, similar to the Pi product.

The announcement of AI assistants for the workplace has been made by a number of companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google.&nbsp;

The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella explained that "Recall is not just about documents." in an interview.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A sophisticated AI model embedded directly inside the device begins to take screenshots of users' activity and then feeds the data collected into an on-board database that analyzes these activities. By using neural processing technology, all images and interactions can be made searchable, even going as far as searching images by themselves.

There are some concerns regarding the events, with Elon Musk warning in a characteristic post that this is akin to an episode of Black Mirror. Going to turn this 'feature' off in the future."&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">OpenAI has introduced the ChatGPT desktop application, now powered by the latest GPT-4o model, which represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence technology. This AI assistant offers real-time screen-reading capabilities, positioning itself as an indispensable support tool for professionals in need of timely assistance. Its enhanced functionality goes beyond merely following user commands; it actively learns from the user's workflow, adapts to individual habits, and anticipates future needs, even taking proactive actions when required. This marks a new era of intelligent and responsive AI companions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Jensen Huang also highlighted the advanced capabilities of AI Companion 2.0, emphasizing that this system does not just observe and support workflows—it learns and evolves with them, making it a more intuitive and helpful partner for users in their professional endeavors.

Meanwhile, Zoom has introduced Zoom Workplace, an AI-powered collaboration platform designed to elevate teamwork and productivity in corporate environments. The platform now offers over 40 new features, which include updates to the Zoom AI Companion for various services such as Zoom Phone, Team Chat, Events, Contact Center, and the "Ask AI Companion" feature.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The AI Companion functions as a generative AI assistant seamlessly integrated throughout Zoom’s platform, enhancing productivity, fostering stronger collaboration among team members, and enabling users to refine and develop their skills through AI-supported insights and assistance.

The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence continue to reshape the technological landscape, as companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google lead the charge in developing AI companions to support both personal and professional endeavors.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">These AI solutions are designed to not only enhance productivity but also provide a more personalized, intuitive experience for users. From Microsoft’s innovative Recall feature to the revamped Copilot and the broad integration of AI companions across platforms like Zoom, these developments mark a significant shift in how humans interact with technology.

While the potential benefits are vast, these innovations also raise important questions about data privacy, human-AI relationships, and the ethical implications of such immersive technology.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As AI continues to evolve and become a more integral part of everyday life, the balance between its benefits and the concerns it may generate will undoubtedly shape the future of AI integration across industries.

Microsoft and its competitors remain at the forefront of this technological revolution, striving to create tools that are not only functional but also responsive to the evolving needs of users in a rapidly changing digital world.</div>

This comes according to the data compiled by the security firm Zimperium, who made a deep analysis of the malware. The firm said that some 40 new variants of TrickMo have been found in the wild. These are associated with 16 dropper applications and 22 different command and control (C2) servers.</p><p>The new report follows earlier research by Cleafy, which had already managed to detect some of these, but not all, variants. TrickMo had been observed used in cyberattacks since September 2019, although it wasn't documented until last year by the IBM X-Force group.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>How TrickMo Works to Deceive</b></p><p>One such feature in this new version of TrickMo is the fake Android lock screen designed to further dupe the users into handing over their PIN or unlock pattern. The screen seems like a real one. It actually renders in full-screen mode to mimic the prompt from an original Android. Once the user inputs his credentials, malware will capture that and transmit over to a remote server along with its unique identifier. This will provide thieves with access to the device later, often when it is not actively monitored, allowing them to go on and carry out whatever fraudulent activities they want.</p><p>In addition, TrickMo has other malicious abilities-the intercepting of one-time passwords, screen recording, exfiltration of data, and even the remote control of the infected device. Thus, TrickMo is another banking trojan, which mainly operates relying on the stealing of login credentials with the presentation of phishing pages of various banks.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>The New Generation of Adaptation Malware</b></p><p>New variants of TrickMo malware attempt to exploit the Accessibility Service permission in Android. As a result, the malware would be able to grab greater control over the device and the possibility of automating different actions without even letting the actual user know about such actions. This is an abuse of accessibility features that grants the malware easier ways for interacting with system prompts, such as giving itself further permissions or making phishing pages appear.</p><p>Cyber security experts consider the mature and dynamic capabilities to make TrickMo a most dangerous threat. The phishing screens will be more likely to capture the users, and once the credentials are captured, then hackers can carry out unauthorised transactions using their banking apps or log in to other sensitive accounts.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Large-scale Impact on Victims</b></p><p>Zimperium's research showed that at least 13,000 victims from several countries, such as Canada, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Germany, have been affected by the TrickMo malware. The real number of attached devices, however, may be much higher as the malware operates through multiple C2 servers.</p><p>It targeted most of the banking applications but has since grown to target many more applications such as VPN services, streaming services, online e-commerce websites, and even social media and enterprise-based platforms. More alarming, it threatens because it can compromise user accounts associated with different kinds of services, not just financial services.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Staying Safe from TrickMo</b></p><p>This spreads through misleading the users into downloading the malicious APK files from unknown sources. To avoid infection, users are not encouraged to click on any links whatsoever-those coming through SMS or direct messages from unknown contacts in particular. Enablement of Google Play Protect is likely to prevent known variants of TrickMo from being installed on Android devices.</p><p>The sophistication level of malware like TrickMo tends to keep reminding everyone of the importance of maintaining their software up to date and not to interact with any unfamiliar apps or websites. As it continues to morph into even dangerous forms, cybersecurity experts have kept alerting Android users to be on high alert and ensure that such security features like Google Play Protect are turned on in order to provide a first line of defence against such threats.</p><p>Zimperium has taken the noble step in releasing TrickMo's C2 infrastructure details on GitHub, thus being in a better position to help cybersecurity experts and organisations ward off the trojan. It is important to note that while saying so, users are advised to be vigilant and take proper measures to ensure their sensitive information will not be compromised by malicious software such as TrickMo.</p><p><br /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikHIm_s_Xkr0Do_iKPAOqbG2ApdG4NWeMZTFWebXEqamv-KFLClbmnLOYNt53Kj8wQsEdeqzFh19wbWknQmap37Rkidcpr9aURgRGD9uGC8XXJ71frVeFhKGdp8Jlx_pcJ-exxD3grE4JCuqoCNFu8rjmUhR6XA0xAKyZSDwBsYi1AhVjSQqB4t7ufsPzj/s1280/chatgpt-7902213_1280.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikHIm_s_Xkr0Do_iKPAOqbG2ApdG4NWeMZTFWebXEqamv-KFLClbmnLOYNt53Kj8wQsEdeqzFh19wbWknQmap37Rkidcpr9aURgRGD9uGC8XXJ71frVeFhKGdp8Jlx_pcJ-exxD3grE4JCuqoCNFu8rjmUhR6XA0xAKyZSDwBsYi1AhVjSQqB4t7ufsPzj/w640-h360/chatgpt-7902213_1280.webp" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Within a year and a half, ChatGPT has grown from an AI prototype to a broad productivity assistant, even sporting its text and code editor called Canvas. Soon, OpenAI will add direct web search capability to ChatGPT, putting the platform at the same table as Google's iconic search. With these fast updates, ChatGPT is now sporting quite a few features that may not be noticed at first glance but are deepening the user experience if one knows where to look.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is the article that will teach you how to tap into ChatGPT, features from customization settings to unique prompting techniques, and not only five must-know tips will be useful in unlocking the full range of abilities of ChatGPT to any kind of task, small or big.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Rename Chats for Better Organisation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A new conversation with ChatGPT begins as a new thread, meaning that it will remember all details concerning that specific exchange but "forget" all the previous ones. This way, you can track the activities of current projects or specific topics because you can name your chats. The chat name that it might try to suggest is related to the flow of the conversation, and these are mostly overlooked contexts that users need to recall again. Renaming your conversations is one simple yet powerful means of staying organised if you rely on ChatGPT for various tasks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To give a name to a conversation, tap the three dots next to the name in the sidebar. You can also archive older chats to remove them from the list without deleting them entirely, so you don't lose access to the conversations that are active.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Customise ChatGPT through Custom Instructions</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Custom Instructions in ChatGPT is a chance to make your answers more specific to your needs because you will get to share your information and preferences with the AI. This is a two-stage personalization where you are explaining to ChatGPT what you want to know about yourself and, in addition, how you would like it to be returned. For instance, if you ask ChatGPT for coding advice several times a week, you can let the AI know what programming languages you are known in or would like to be instructed in so it can fine-tune the responses better. Or, you should be able to ask for ChatGPT to provide more verbose descriptions or to skip steps in order to make more intuitive knowledge of a topic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To set up personal preferences, tap the profile icon on the upper right, and then from the menu, "Customise ChatGPT," and then fill out your preferences. Doing this will enable you to get responses tailored to your interests and requirements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Choose the Right Model for Your Use</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a subscriber to ChatGPT Plus, you have access to one of several AI models each tailored to different tasks. The default model for most purposes is GPT-4-turbo (GPT-4o), which tends to strike the best balance between speed and functionality and even supports other additional features, including file uploads, web browsing, and dataset analysis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, other models are useful when one needs to describe a rather complex project with substantial planning. You may initiate a project using o1-preview that requires deep research and then shift the discussion to GPT-4-turbo to get quick responses. To switch models, you can click on the model dropdown at the top of your screen or type in a forward slash (/) in the chat box to get access to more available options including web browsing and image creation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4. Look at what the GPT Store has available in the form of Mini-Apps</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Custom GPTs, and the GPT Store enable "mini-applications" that are able to extend the functionality of the platform. The Custom GPTs all have some inbuilt prompts and workflows and sometimes even APIs to extend the AI capability of GPT. For instance, with Canva's GPT, you are able to create logos, social media posts, or presentations straight within the ChatGPT portal by linking up the Canva tool. That means you can co-create visual content with ChatGPT without having to leave the portal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">And if there are some prompts you often need to apply, or some dataset you upload most frequently, you can easily create your Custom GPT. This would be really helpful to handle recipes, keeping track of personal projects, create workflow shortcuts and much more. Go to the GPT Store by the "Explore GPTs" button in the sidebar. Your recent and custom GPTs will appear in the top tab, so find them easily and use them as necessary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5. Manage Conversations with a Fresh Approach</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the best benefit of using ChatGPT, it is key to understand that every new conversation is an independent document with its "memory." It does recall enough from previous conversations, though generally speaking, its answers depend on what is being discussed in the immediate chat. This made chats on unrelated projects or topics best started anew for clarity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For long-term projects, it might even be logical to go on with a single thread so that all relevant information is kept together. For unrelated topics, it might make more sense to start fresh each time to avoid confusion. Another way in which archiving or deleting conversations you no longer need can help free up your interface and make access to active threads easier is</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What Makes AI Unique Compared to Other Software?</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AI performs very differently from other software in that it responds dynamically, at times providing responses or "backtalk" and does not simply do what it is told to do. Such a property leads to some trial and error to obtain the desired output. For instance, one might prompt ChatGPT to review its own output as demonstrated by replacing single quote characters by double quote characters to generate more accurate results. This is similar to how a developer optimises an AI model, guiding ChatGPT to "think" through something in several steps.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ChatGPT Canvas and other features like Custom GPTs make the AI behave more like software in the classical sense—although, of course, with personality and learning. If ChatGPT continues to grow in this manner, features such as these may make most use cases easier and more delightful.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following these five tips should help you make the most of ChatGPT as a productivity tool and keep pace with the latest developments. From renaming chats to playing around with Custom GPTs, all of them add to a richer and more customizable user experience.</p><br />

"We're not here to safeguard e-commerce, but we do protect small and medium-sized businesses. "There are millions who must be protected," the minister stated.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">If Temu makes such a move, Jakarta will likewise block its investment in local e-commerce, according to Budi, who added that he is unaware of any such plan. Additionally, Budi stated that the government intends to ask Shein, a Chinese online retailer, for a similar ban. 

Last year, Indonesia compelled China's ByteDance social media network TikTok to shut down its online shopfront in order to safeguard the privacy of local users and merchants.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Months later, TikTok agreed to acquire a majority stake in Indonesian digital behemoth GoTo's e-commerce subsidiary in order to maintain its presence in Southeast Asia's largest e-commerce market.

As a way of tricking people into sharing sensitive information, hackers use advanced techniques, including realistic artificial intelligence-generated scam calls posing as Google Support and impersonating the company's representatives.

It has been reported that a new and sophisticated scam has been targeting Gmail users, intending to steal personal information by tricking users into approving fake account recovery requests by posing as Gmail employees.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A technology consultant and blogger, Sam Mitrovic, shared a detailed blog post detailing his experience with the scam, which emphasized how easy it would be for users to fall victim to this AI-based deception based on clever deception techniques.

It begins with an unexpected email or text message telling users that an automated recovery request has been sent to their Gmail account, and they will be asked to agree to it.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As Mitrovic's case illustrates, the majority of recovery requests come from other countries, such as the United States in Mitrovic's case. It's still not over for Mitrovic though, because about 40 minutes after declining the request, the scammers make their second move-a phone call from what appears to be an official Google number that they pretend to be.

The email message appears highly authentic since it uses personal information such as names, addresses, or past communications to convey a strong sense of authenticity. They use several methods to trick users into clicking on malicious links or providing sensitive information, such as login credentials, payment information, and other sensitive information to the attackers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Microsoft solution consultant Sam Mitrovic recently posted an article in his blog about his personal experience with this alarming trend as he highlighted to his readers how difficult it can be to identify these scams. 

The first notification Mitrovic received from a phishing scam asked him to approve a recovery attempt for a Gmail account. This was a classic phishing attempt aimed at stealing login credentials from Mitrovic. He wisely ignored the alert, knowing that there was a potential danger involved.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result, the attackers were persistent and didn't let up; not long after getting the notification, he got a new notification informing him that he had missed a call from "Google Sydney."

The following week, he received the same notification, along with a phone call from the same number. It was the second time he had picked up the phone. Mitrovic said that the American voice on the other end of the line informed him that something suspicious had happened with his Google account a week ago, and someone had accessed it during that period. Apparently, the Google employee, who offered to send an email outlining what happened, did so promptly, and that message arrived from an official Google email address within a short period.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A key point that Mitrovic stresses is the importance of being vigilant in preventing these scams from taking place. 

Users of Gmail are strongly advised to take precautionary measures in light of the increasing sophistication of AI-driven cyber threats. One critical recommendation is to avoid approving account recovery requests that were not personally initiated.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If a recovery notification is received unexpectedly, it should not be approved, as this could be an indication that the account is being targeted for unauthorized access.

In the case of phone calls purporting to be from Google, it is important to remain vigilant. Google rarely contacts users directly unless they are engaging with Google Business services.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Should a call be received claiming to be from Google, it is recommended to immediately hang up and verify the phone number independently before continuing any interaction.

Users should also pay close attention to email addresses in communications that appear to be from Google. Spoofed emails may seem legitimate, but careful inspection of details such as the “To” field or the domain name can reveal whether the email is fake.

It is advisable to regularly review the security settings of one's Gmail account and examine recent security activity for unfamiliar logins or suspicious behaviour. This can be done by navigating to the “Security” tab within Gmail account settings, where recent login activity and security alerts are displayed.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For more technologically inclined users, examining the original email headers can provide valuable insights into whether the email was sent from a legitimate Google server. This level of scrutiny can help identify phishing or spoofing attempts with greater accuracy.

By following these steps, Gmail users can enhance their security posture and better protect themselves from AI-based scams. The key takeaway is to exercise caution and thoroughly verify any unusual activity or communications related to their accounts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The rise of AI-powered hacking techniques poses a significant threat to the security of Gmail users worldwide. As these sophisticated scams become more prevalent and harder to detect, users need to remain vigilant and proactive in protecting their accounts. By carefully reviewing recovery requests, verifying any communication claiming to be from Google, and regularly monitoring account security settings, users can minimize the risk of falling victim to these advanced cyberattacks. Staying informed and exercising caution is critical in safeguarding personal information and maintaining the integrity of online accounts amidst this evolving threat landscape.</div>

By all accounts, this partnership constitutes a "game changer." The United Coalition focuses on revealing and thwarting fraudulent activity online.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Online Scam Fighting via the Global Signal Exchange</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The coalition will be launching a data platform called Global Signal Exchange, which will 24/7 scan open cyberspaces for signs of fraudulent activity and issue alerts. For a platform, it will leverage the DNS Research Federation's DAP.live: an aggregation platform that consolidates feeds from over 100 sources to spot potential scams. Google enhances these efforts while providing relevant feeds from DAP.live that should provide an even more comprehensive view of online fraud as it begins to take shape.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A Growing Threat in the Digital Age</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some scams are becoming almost too clever nowadays, to the extent that an estimated $8.6 billion is lost worldwide due to such scams each year, with few cases going to convictions. In the UK alone, each person is targeted nearly 240 times a year by a scammer via emails or texts from fake legitimate businesses or offices asking them for personal information, such as bank or credit card details.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Britain estimates the average loss per person due to scams is £1,169. Overall, 11% of adults admit that they have fallen for online fraud. More alarming is the economic loss in the proportion of older adults, which indicates people aged 55 and above lose an average amount of £2,151. Those between 36 and 54 lose about £1,270, while those less than 35 years old lose about £851.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Call for International Cooperation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another challenge while combating online scams is that many of the criminal organisations behind these scams are operating from abroad, often from such countries as Russia and North Korea. This international nature makes it even more difficult for local authorities to keep an eye on and legally prosecute them. The coalition aims to balance this gap by sharing scam information in real time, thereby creating a chance to respond quickly to new emerging threats. This collaborative approach will serve crucially because cybercriminals often operate in groups and have done all of this work so fast, which has made it really hard to fight scams alone by any single organisation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Scammers collaborate, they pool and they act fast. The days when individual brands could combat cybercrime on their own are gone. Global Signal Exchange usher in a new chapter in the battle against cybercrime, and Google's partnership promises to be the game-changer," said Emily Taylor, Chief Executive of DNS Research Federation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Scammers Use All Too Familiar Brand Names Trapping Victims</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The research carried out by the coalition indicates that fraudsters make use of the identity of conspicuous brands to acquire victims. Some of the very popular brands currently being used in scams are: home delivery and courier services; financial services, including banks, insurance, and loan companies; companies in the Technology, Media, and Telecoms sector; many public sector organisations, including HMRC and local councils; and, in a few instances, prominent charities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to DNS Research Federation, the volume of scams seems to peak each year in November during the Black Friday promotions and associated online shopping. Much of such activity is occurring because of heightened online activity. Thus, proper defences are quite essential when activity reaches such peak levels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>An alliance towards consumers' protection around the world</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Global Anti-Scam Alliance was established in 2021 to create a network of businesses that stand together to protect consumers online from fraud. GASA, in partnership with Google and the DNS Research Federation, will decrease the profitability of scams in order to make them less appealing to cybercriminals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As threats in cyber continue to grow and seemingly intensify, this alliance will very largely form a critical element in the protection of users internationally. The Global Signal Exchange represents a major leap forward in efforts on anti-scam activities as it promises that consumers will be better protected from online fraud, and are able to navigate an increasingly complex digital environment more securely.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

When you turn on a smart TV from LG, Samsung, or Sony, data is collected from the TV itself, as well as the operating system and apps. Then there are the gadgets you connect to your television, like Google's Chromecast, Apple TV, and Amazon's Fire Stick.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">A TV is now more than just a screen for entertainment; it's a two-way mirror that lets a network of data brokers and advertisers watch you in real time, stated Rowenna Fielding, director of data protection consultancy Miss IG Geek. “The purpose of this is to gather as much information as possible about your behaviour, interests, preferences and demographics so it can be monetised, mainly through targeted advertising.”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your smart TV's data collection relies on the manufacturer, brand, and version. In theory, most smart TVs can gather audio, video, and TV usage data, according to Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at cybersecurity firm Darktrace.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Voice activation is a function that has the ability to collect significant volumes of data. Microphones and software listen for instructions and can record conversations and other noises within range. These recordings can be sent to third parties for analysis.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>What does your TV do with the data?</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">There is no clear answer. According to Lewis, what is done with the data is complex and "highly opaque". When looking at what a smart TV does on the network, it is often unclear why certain data is being harvested and where it is being sent.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">There isn't much distinction between television brands. Manufacturers claim to utilise your information for "personalisation" and content quality, although it is usual to sell anonymous or semi-anonymized data to third parties, advertising companies, or streaming services.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“After the data has been sold, it is out of the manufacturer’s control,” Lewis explains. "It is often unclear what data exactly is being sent back, depending on the T&amp;Cs and privacy settings, and it can be very difficult to change default settings once you have agreed to them.”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>What is Automatic Content Recognition (ACR)?&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Automated content recognition (ACR) is one alarming feature to keep an eye out for. This feature, which is frequently enabled by default, uses analytical techniques to detect video and audio on the TV and compares it to a large database to determine what is playing. It's fairly disturbing stuff; ACR works on anything played on television, including DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, and games.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security company ESET, explains that viewing data and habits are shared with manufacturers and eventually sold to advertisers in order to target you with adverts. When your TV is connected to your home router, data will include your IP address and position.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Lewis adds that ACR may theoretically be utilised for even more ominous profiling. "Data from facial recognition, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text, and content analysis could be gathered to build an in-depth picture of an individual user with the analytical technologies available."&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Lewis suggests that rather than comparing material to a catalogue of well-known films, ACR may theoretically be examined for factors like political stance, ethnicity, social status, and other characteristics that could be misused.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Safety tips&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Smart TVs will gather data as long as they are connected to the internet, and it is impossible to prevent this from happening. In many cases, doing so is not in your best interests because it will interfere with your viewing experience; for example, Netflix's useful suggestions tool.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, there are several simple steps you may take to protect yourself from smart TV snooping. Turn off ACR in the settings, disable customisation, opt out of all advertising features, and hide or disable cameras and microphones.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It's also vital to secure your router by changing the password and creating a guest network. You may increase security by opting out of online tracking when it's provided and installing software updates as soon as possible.</span></div></span>

A new study shows that it is capable of attacking Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption, which is used by web browsers, VPNs, email services, and chips of companies such as Samsung and LG, among others.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which was adopted by the US government in 2001, can also be hacked by this tool. According to Chinese researchers, there is a real and substantial threat to classical cryptography, which is widely used in financial and military sectors as well as secure communication networks. SCMP published a report last week stating that the researchers utilized a quantum computer known as a D-Wave to mount the first quantum attacks on well-established cryptographic algorithms using quantum computing.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There are some substitution-permutation-network (SPN) algorithms that can be found in widely used standards such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which are both cryptographic algorithms classed as substitution-permutation networks (SPNs). While general-purpose quantum computing is still a long way from being fully operational, there has been a lot of research occurring in this area as well as in specialised quantum computing.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Modern cryptography, though, should not be considered to be at risk from quantum computing as it does not pose an immediate threat. Professor Wang Chao, a colleague of mine at the Shanghai University, was also part of the team that successfully exploited the quantum computers which were produced by D-Wave Systems, a Canadian company, to crack cryptographic algorithms as part of a new research paper. It is the team of Wang and his students that claim that this is one of the first times that a real quantum computer has presented a substantial threat to fully-scaled SPN-structured algorithms that are used today.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, even though the researchers were not able to crack specific passcodes, they warn that quantum computers might be able to challenge modern encryption systems within the next few years. A quantum computer, which exploits quantum tunnelling and annealing to solve complex problems with higher efficiency and accuracy, operates by principles completely different from classical computers. As reported by the SCMP, Wang's team merged quantum techniques with conventional mathematical methods to develop an algorithm capable of breaching algorithms such as Present, Gift-64, and Rectangle designed to evade quantum techniques.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Despite this breakthrough in quantum computing, the researchers acknowledge certain limitations currently holding the technology back, such as hardware immaturity and interference caused by the environment, which are currently preventing its full potential from being realized. Because of the sensitive nature of the research, Wang did not elaborate further on the findings. Researchers from Shanghai University, led by Wang Chao, have reportedly made significant strides in attacking military-grade encryption using quantum computing technology.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Their efforts targeted Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) algorithms, including Present, Gift-64, and Rectangle—systems that form the backbone of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES-256, in particular, is frequently cited as "military-grade" encryption and is believed to offer resistance against quantum computing attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, the specific methods employed by Wang and his team to break these encryption systems remain unclear. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Wang declined to provide further details, citing the sensitivity of the research. Despite this, the researchers have indicated that their work represents a substantial breakthrough. They claim that, for the first time, a quantum computer has posed a "real and substantial" threat to multiple full-scale SPN-structured algorithms currently in use. This was outlined in a peer-reviewed paper published in the Chinese Journal of Computers, a Mandarin-language journal.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The paper highlights the potential risk quantum computing now poses to modern encryption standards. While many existing quantum systems are not yet considered advanced enough to threaten contemporary cryptology, this research suggests that the timeline for quantum machines to break widely used cryptographic algorithms may be shorter than previously expected. The researchers warned that the ability to crack these codes is closer than ever before.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Currently, most general-purpose quantum systems are still in the developmental stages, and it is widely believed that practical quantum computers capable of breaking modern encryption systems are several years away. D-Wave Systems, which claims to be the world’s first commercial quantum computer supplier, counts major organizations like Lockheed Martin, NASA, and Google among its early adopters. Despite these advancements, many cryptography experts are working to develop "quantum-proof" encryption methods to safeguard against future risks posed by more powerful quantum machines.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems that traditional computers cannot, and in the long term, they could become capable of breaking most public-key encryption algorithms. This has spurred global efforts to future-proof cryptographic systems against the eventual rise of fully capable quantum computing technologies.</div>

There are some clear barriers to better adoption, particularly carrier support. But the underlying issue is much simpler: WhatsApp. This long-awaited partial integration of iMessage and Google Messages has been so delayed that WhatsApp has effectively locked down every significant market outside of the United States (and China).&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">With Apple's iMessage security being one of its main selling points, security and privacy have grown so central to the iPhone and its user base that an update that abandons all of that appears counter-intuitive in every sense. The fact that even Google is unable to view user content due to its extensive usage of end-to-end encryption throughout its own platform—which is akin to Apple's—makes this situation worse. However, all of that disappears when using cross-platform RCS texting.,</span></div></span>

<title>Risk, reward and reality: Has enterprise perception of the public cloud changed?</title>
<link>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/risk-reward-reality-enterprise-perception-public-cloud/</link>
<guid>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/risk-reward-reality-enterprise-perception-public-cloud/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Public clouds now form the bulk of enterprise IT environments. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/817296/worldwide-enterprise-cloud-strategy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Statista data</a>, 73% of enterprises use a hybrid cloud model, 14% use multiple public clouds and 10% use a single public cloud solution. Multiple and single private clouds make up the remaining 3%.</p>
<p>With enterprises historically reticent to adopt public clouds, adoption data seems to indicate a shift in perception. Perhaps enterprise efforts have finally moved away from reducing risk to prioritizing the potential rewards of public cloud resources.</p>
<p>Reality, however, isn&rsquo;t so cut-and-dry. Here&rsquo;s a look at the current state of public perception, where enterprises still encounter cloud issues and how familiar concerns have a new focus: AI.</p>
<h2>Public perception on cloud computing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cloud computing</a> has always had a perception problem. From the perspective of enterprise C-suites and IT teams, public clouds meant bigger <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">attack surfaces</a> combined with lower visibility, giving attackers the upper hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from the perspective of consumers &mdash; which all C-suite and IT team members become on their days off &mdash; the cloud came with massive potential. From file and photo storage to streaming video services and worldwide e-commerce, the public cloud quickly became commonplace in public life.</p>
<p>So why the disconnect? In large part, enterprises were concerned about the man behind the curtain. While many providers were long on promises, they were short on details. The result was a &ldquo;shared responsibility&rdquo; model that saw both customer and provider playing a role in data defense, but neither one was entirely clear on what that role entailed. This was exemplified by a Capital One <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data breach</a> in 2019, which saw both the bank and its cloud partner, AWS, <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/shared-responsibility-models-cloud-security-azure-aws-google/596579/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">under scrutiny for their security</a>.</p>
<p>To help address these concerns, cloud providers doubled down on security. In 2021, Amazon, Google, IBM and Apple <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/tech-giants-commit-30b-to-cybersecurity-after-white-house-meeting/2021/08/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pledged $30 billion</a> to help address growing security concerns. It worked: In 2024, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/12/latest-trends-and-predictions-for-the-future-of-cloud-hosting/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">94% of businesses</a> reported improvement in security after moving to the cloud. Or consider the results of Flexera&rsquo;s State of the Cloud Report: In <a href="https://www.flexera.com/about-us/press-center/flexera-releases-2020-state-of-the-cloud-report" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2020</a>, security was the top concern among executives. In 2024, security has fallen to second place.</p>
<p>The data tells the tale: Enterprise public cloud perception is changing.</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-53217">Strengthen your cloud defenses</a>
<h2>Ongoing cloud challenges</h2>
<p>While cloud providers have made significant strides in addressing security concerns, other issues remain.</p>
<p>For example, the top challenge in Flexera&rsquo;s 2024 State of the Cloud Report is managing cloud spend, cited by 82% of enterprises, while lack of resources and expertise comes in third with 79%.</p>
<p>When it comes to cloud spending, there&rsquo;s no easy answer. In fact, ease is sometimes the issue. As providers streamline the process of purchasing, deploying and integrating cloud-based applications and services, it&rsquo;s easy for enterprises to lose track of exactly what they have, exactly where it is and exactly how much it costs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that spending shows up twice on the Flexera report: Once in the top spot for cloud spend at large and again in fourth place as companies struggle to manage software licenses across multiple clouds and applications.</p>
<p>Lack of resources and expertise, meanwhile, remains a persistent challenge for enterprises. According to research from <a href="https://www.softwareone.com/en/blog/articles/2023/11/13/cloud-skills-gap-in-2023" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Software One</a>, 95% of businesses now face a cloud and IT skills gap. While upskilling current staff can help reduce the impact of this gap, the expansion of public cloud environments creates the longer term problem of doing more work with fewer people. While it&rsquo;s possible to task IT teams with handling the public cloud in addition to other line-of-business objectives, the results can lead back to the original concern with cloud deployments: Reduced security.</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s old is new again</h2>
<p>Even as enterprises come to terms with the necessity and ubiquity of the cloud, a new challenge has emerged: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the public cloud, artificial intelligence has the potential to change the way enterprises do business. But it also opens new avenues for security compromise, leading many companies to remain cautious of AI adoption.</p>
<p>In some cases, this means limiting the scope of AI in enterprise environments. For example, organizations might leverage AI in process automation but shy away from using generative tools for content creation or sales efforts. They might deploy <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI solutions</a> to analyze disparate data but only trust humans to turn output into action.</p>
<p>The result is a perceptive landscape that is both similar and distinct from its cloud predecessor. Consider recent data from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-30-gartner-survey-shows-rising-concern-of-ai-enhanced-malicious-attacks-as" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, which found that the top concern cities by companies in Q2 2024 were AI-enhanced malicious attacks. This aligns with historic worries about the public cloud as a path to compromise &mdash; if attackers could access shared resources, they could potentially cause inter-departmental chaos.</p>
<p>AI, however, comes with a unique concern: Evolution. While cloud-based threats made use of expanded attack surfaces, they remained fundamentally the same as their previous-generation counterparts: If tools didn&rsquo;t work, it was back to the drawing board for malicious actors.</p>
<p>In the case of AI, meanwhile, code isn&rsquo;t static. Instead, both failure and success inform the next iteration of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ransomware</a> tools or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/malware" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Malware</a>-as-a-Service offerings. This ongoing improvement is similarly present on the protective side of AI adoption, but in both cases &mdash; attack and defense &mdash; the approach to AI is naturally different than that of the cloud.</p>
<h2>The reality of cloud security</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-security" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="resolved">Cloud security</span></a> has evolved from nebulous assurance to core component of public offerings. The results speak for themselves: More enterprises are adopting the public cloud, more enterprises are reporting improved security and fewer companies are citing security as their to-cloud challenge.</p>
<p>AI, meanwhile, has stepped up to take on the role of top security concern. In much the same way as cloud computing, some concerns around <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ai-cybersecurity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI security</a> are overblown &mdash; as the market diversifies and standardization becomes critical, companies can expect common security issues to be effectively resolved.</p>
<p>Where AI and cloud go their separate ways, however, is in the evolution of future threats. While cloud frameworks have changed to meet new corporate needs, they remain fundamentally bound by basic infrastructure. AI has no such limits, making it harder to predict the course of its development over time.</p>
<p>The reality? Cloud perception has shifted to reward. The rise of AI, however, now underpins a renewed focus on enterprise <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a> risk.</p>

<title>Safer with Google: Advancing Memory Safety</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/safer-with-google-advancing-memory.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/safer-with-google-advancing-memory.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Alex Rebert, Security Foundations, and Chandler Carruth, Jen Engel, Andy Qin, Core Developers</span>

<p>
Error-prone interactions between software and memory<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> are <a href="http://phrack.org/archives/issues/49/14.txt">widely understood</a> to create safety issues in software. It is estimated that about 70% of severe vulnerabilities<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> in memory-unsafe codebases are due to memory safety bugs. Malicious actors exploit these vulnerabilities and continue to create real-world harm. In 2023, Google’s threat intelligence teams conducted an industry-wide study and observed a <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/Year_in_Review_of_ZeroDays.pdf">close to all-time high number of vulnerabilities exploited in the wild</a>. Our internal analysis estimates that 75% of CVEs used in <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/0day.html">zero-day exploits</a> are memory safety vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
At Google, we have been mindful of these issues for over two decades, and are on a journey to continue advancing the state of memory safety in the software we consume and produce. Our <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tackling-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-through-secure-by-design/">Secure by Design</a> commitment emphasizes integrating security considerations, including robust memory safety practices, throughout the entire software development lifecycle. This proactive approach fosters a safer and more trustworthy digital environment for everyone.
</p>
<p>
This post builds upon our previously reported <a href="https://research.google/pubs/secure-by-design-googles-perspective-on-memory-safety/">Perspective on Memory Safety</a>, and introduces our strategic approach to memory safety. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Our journey so far</strong>
</p>
<p>
Google's journey with memory safety is deeply intertwined with the evolution of the software industry itself. In our early days, we recognized the importance of balancing performance with safety. This led to the early adoption of memory-safe languages like Java and Python, and the creation of Go.  Today these languages comprise a large portion of our code, providing memory safety among other benefits. Meanwhile, the rest of our code is predominantly written in C++, previously the optimal choice for high-performance demands.
</p>
<p>
We recognized the inherent risks associated with memory-unsafe languages and developed tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_sanitizer">sanitizers</a>, which detect memory safety bugs dynamically, and fuzzers like <a href="https://github.com/google/AFL">AFL</a> and <a href="https://releases.llvm.org/8.0.0/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libfuzzer</a>, which proactively test the robustness and security of a software application by repeatedly feeding unexpected inputs. By open-sourcing these tools, we've empowered developers worldwide to reduce the likelihood of memory safety vulnerabilities in C and C++ codebases. Taking this commitment a step further, we provide continuous fuzzing to open-source projects through <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/12/announcing-oss-fuzz-continuous-fuzzing.html">OSS-Fuzz</a>, which helped get over <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/02/taking-next-step-oss-fuzz-in-2023.html">8800 vulnerabilities identified and subsequently fixed across 850 projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, with the emergence of high-performance memory-safe languages like Rust, coupled with a deeper understanding of the limitations of purely detection-based approaches, we are focused primarily on preventing the introduction of security vulnerabilities at scale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Going forward: Google's two-pronged approach</strong>
</p>
<p>
Google's long-term strategy for tackling memory safety challenges is multifaceted, recognizing the need to address both existing codebases and future development, while maintaining the pace of business.
</p>
<p>
Our long-term objective is to progressively and consistently integrate memory-safe languages into Google's codebases while phasing out memory-unsafe code in new development. Given the amount of C++ code we use, we anticipate a residual amount of mature and stable memory-unsafe code will remain for the foreseeable future.
</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSRbsz3UFa32nAEek2cEOIN-IM5XN6df3vibnuP7nmzJoYLMAfkHgjlAcbCbjGmV0THU_CMtP9vgs3EHHe7zwRqeuXbQoxA_EGrqDMLDRJShnakXuMxesVqDJaq2xPWcpyqCcRpvW3-ZWJiZu2LXtyEs23CvI4jOBkw89T1iSVWHl-j4OYMsC0EN0E4dFh/s3355/memory%20safety%20graphic.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSRbsz3UFa32nAEek2cEOIN-IM5XN6df3vibnuP7nmzJoYLMAfkHgjlAcbCbjGmV0THU_CMtP9vgs3EHHe7zwRqeuXbQoxA_EGrqDMLDRJShnakXuMxesVqDJaq2xPWcpyqCcRpvW3-ZWJiZu2LXtyEs23CvI4jOBkw89T1iSVWHl-j4OYMsC0EN0E4dFh/s600/memory%20safety%20graphic.png" width="600" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Graphic of memory-safe language growth as memory-unsafe code is hardened and gradually decreased over time.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Migration to Memory-Safe Languages (MSLs)</strong>
</p>
<p>
The first pillar of our strategy is centered on further increasing the adoption of memory-safe languages. These languages drastically drive down the risk of memory-related errors through features like garbage collection and borrow checking, embodying the same Safe Coding<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> principles that successfully eliminated other vulnerability classes like cross-site scripting (XSS) at scale. Google has already embraced MSLs like Java, Kotlin, Go, and Python for a large portion of our code. 
</p>
<p>
Our next target is to ramp up memory-safe languages with the necessary capabilities to address the needs of even more of our low-level environments where C++ has remained dominant. For example, we are investing to expand Rust usage at Google beyond Android and other mobile use cases and into our server, application, and embedded ecosystems. This will unlock the use of MSLs in low-level code environments where C and C++ have typically been the language of choice. In addition, we are exploring more seamless interoperability with C++ through <a href="https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang">Carbon</a>, as a means to accelerate even more of our transition to MSLs.  
</p>
<p>
In Android, which runs on billions of devices and is one of our most critical platforms, we've already made strides in adopting MSLs, including Rust, in sections of our network, firmware and graphics stacks. We specifically focused on adopting memory safety in <em>new code</em> instead of rewriting mature and stable memory-unsafe C or C++ codebases. As we've previously <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html">discussed</a>, this strategy is driven by vulnerability trends as memory safety vulnerabilities were typically introduced shortly before being discovered.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the number of memory safety vulnerabilities reported in Android has decreased dramatically and quickly, dropping from more than 220 in 2019 to a projected 36 by the end of this year, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategic shift. Given that memory-safety vulnerabilities are particularly severe, the reduction in memory safety vulnerabilities is leading to a <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html#:~:text=With%20the%20drop%20in%20memory%20safety%20vulnerabilities%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20seeing%20a%20corresponding%20drop%20in%20vulnerability%20severity.">corresponding drop in vulnerability severity</a>, representing a reduction in security risk. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Risk Reduction for Memory-Unsafe Code </strong>
</p>
<p>
While transitioning to memory-safe languages is the long-term strategy, and one that requires investment now, we recognize the immediate responsibility we have to protect the safety of our billions of users during this process. This means we cannot ignore the reality of a large codebase written in memory-unsafe languages (MULs) like C and C++.
</p>
<p>
Therefore the second pillar of our strategy focuses on risk reduction & containment of this portion of our codebase. This incorporates:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>C++ Hardening:</strong> We are retrofitting safety at scale in our memory-unsafe code, based on our <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5896512897417216/a-recipe-for-scaling-security">experience eliminating web vulnerabilities</a>. While we won't make C and C++ memory safe, we are eliminating sub-classes of vulnerabilities in the code we own, as well as reducing the risks of the remaining vulnerabilities through exploit mitigations.
<p>

    We have allocated a portion of our computing resources specifically to <a href="https://libcxx.llvm.org/Hardening.html">bounds-checking the C++ standard library</a> across our workloads. While bounds-checking overhead is small for individual applications, deploying it at Google's scale requires significant computing resources. This underscores our deep commitment to enhancing the safety and security of our products and services. Early results are promising, and we'll share more details in a future post.
</p>
<p>

    In Chrome, we have also been rolling out <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/01/miracleptr-protecting-users-from-use.html">MiraclePtr</a> over the past few years, which effectively mitigated 57% of use-after-free vulnerabilities in privileged processes, and has been <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-review-of-zero-day-in-the-wild-exploits-in-2023/">linked</a> to a decrease of in-the-wild exploits.
</p></li>

<li><strong>Security Boundaries: </strong>We are continuing<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to strengthen critical components of our software infrastructure through expanded use of<a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation/"> isolation techniques</a> like sandboxing and privilege reduction, limiting the potential impact of vulnerabilities. For example, earlier this year, we shipped the beta release of our <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sandbox">V8 heap sandbox</a> and included it in <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/chrome-friends/5745167867576320/chrome-vulnerability-reward-program-rules#v8-sandbox-bypass-rewards">Chrome's Vulnerability Reward Program</a>.<br /></li>

<li><strong>Bug Detection</strong>: We are investing in bug detection tooling and innovative research such as <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/06/project-naptime.html">Naptime</a> and making ML-guided fuzzing as effortless and wide-spread as testing. While we are increasingly shifting towards memory safety by design, these tools and techniques remain a critical component of proactively identifying and reducing risks, especially against vulnerability classes currently lacking strong preventative controls.
<p>
In addition, we are actively working with the semiconductor and research communities on emerging hardware-based approaches to improve memory safety. This includes our work to <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/test/memory-safety/arm-mte">support</a> and <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/08/summary-mte-as-implemented.html">validate the efficacy</a> of <a href="https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/enhancing-memory-safety">Memory Tagging Extension</a> (MTE). Device implementations are starting to roll out, including within Google’s corporate environment. We are also conducting ongoing research into <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI)</a> architecture which can provide finer grained memory protections and safety controls, particularly appealing in security-critical environments like embedded systems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Looking ahead</strong>
</p>
<p>
We believe it’s important to embrace the opportunity to achieve memory safety at scale, and that it will have a positive impact on the safety of the broader digital ecosystem. This path forward requires continuous investment and innovation to drive safety and velocity, and we remain committed to the broader community to walk this path together.
</p>
<p>
We will provide future publications on memory safety that will go deeper into specific aspects of our strategy.

<p>
Janine Roberta Ferreira was driving home from work in São Paulo when she stopped at a traffic light. A man suddenly appeared and broke the window of her unlocked car, grabbing her phone. She struggled with him for a moment before he wrestled the phone away and ran off. The incident left her deeply shaken. Not only was she saddened at the loss of precious data, like pictures of her nephew, but she also felt vulnerable knowing her banking information was on her phone that was just stolen by a thief. 
</p>
<p>
Situations like Janine’s highlighted the need for a comprehensive solution to phone theft that exceeded existing tools on any platform. Phone theft is a widespread concern in many countries – <a href="https://forumseguranca.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/07-anuario-2022-os-crimes-patrimoniais-no-brasil-entre-novas-e-velhas-dinamicas.pdf">97 phones are robbed or stolen every hour in Brazil</a>. The GSM Association <a href="https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/connectivity-for-good/public-policy/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Safety-privacy-and-security-across-the-mobile-ecosystem.pdf">reports</a> millions of devices stolen every year, and the numbers continue to grow. 
</p>
<p>
With our phones becoming increasingly central to storing sensitive data, like payment information and personal details, losing one can be an unsettling experience. That’s why we developed and thoroughly <a href="https://blog.google/intl/pt-br/produtos/android-chrome-play/recursos-do-android-contra-roubo-de-celular-chegam-ao-brasil/">beta tested</a>, a full suite of features designed to protect you and your data at every stage – before, during, and after device theft. <br /><strong><em><br />These advanced theft protection features are now available to users around the world through <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-15/" target="_blank">Android 15</a> and a Google Play Services update (Android 10+ devices). </em></strong>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
</p>
<h1><strong>AI-powered protection for your device the moment it is stolen  </strong></h1>


<p>
<strong>Theft Detection Lock</strong> uses powerful AI to proactively protect you at the moment of a theft attempt. By using on-device machine learning, Theft Detection Lock is able to analyze various device signals to detect potential theft attempts. If the algorithm detects a potential theft attempt on your unlocked device, it locks your screen to keep thieves out.
</p>
<p>
To protect your sensitive data if your phone is stolen, Theft Detection Lock uses device sensors to identify theft attempts. We’re working hard to bring this feature to as many devices as possible. This feature is rolling out gradually to ensure compatibility with various devices, starting today with Android devices that cover 90% of active users worldwide. Check your theft protection settings page periodically to see if your device is currently supported. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to Theft Detection Lock, <strong>Offline Device Lock</strong> protects you if a thief tries to take your device offline to extract data or avoid a remote wipe via Android’s <strong>Find My Device</strong>. If an unlocked device goes offline for prolonged periods, this feature locks the screen to ensure your phone can’t be used in the hands of a thief. 
</p>
<p>
If your Android device does become lost or stolen, <strong>Remote Lock </strong>can quickly help you secure it. Even if you can’t remember your Google account credentials in the moment of theft, you can use any device to visit <a href="http://Android.com/lock">Android.com/lock</a> and lock your phone with just a verified phone number. Remote Lock secures your device while you regain access through Android’s Find My Device – which lets you secure, locate or remotely wipe your device. As a security best practice, we always recommend <a href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9149304?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">backing up your device</a> on a continuous basis, so remotely wiping your device is not an issue.
</p>
<p>
<em>These features are now available on most Android 10+ devices</em><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><em> via a Google Play Services update and must be enabled in settings. </em>
</p>
<h1><strong>Advanced security to deter theft before it happens </strong></h1>


<p>
Android 15 introduces new security features to deter theft before it happens by making it harder for thieves to access sensitive settings, apps, or reset your device for resale: <br />
</p>
<ul>

<li>Changes to sensitive settings like Find My Device now require your PIN, password, or biometric authentication. </li>

<li>Multiple failed login attempts, which could be a sign that a thief is trying to guess your password, will lock down your device, preventing unauthorized access. </li>

<li>And enhanced factory reset protection makes it even harder for thieves to reset your device without your Google account credentials, significantly reducing its resale value and protecting your data. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Later this year, we’ll launch <strong>Identity Check</strong>, an opt-in feature that will add an extra layer of protection by requiring biometric authentication when accessing critical Google account and device settings, like changing your PIN, disabling theft protection, or accessing Passkeys from an untrusted location. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if your device PIN is compromised.
</p>
<h1><strong>Real-world protection for billions of Android users</strong></h1>


<p>
By integrating advanced technology like AI and biometric authentication, we're making Android devices less appealing targets for thieves to give you greater peace of mind. These theft protection features are just one example of how Android is working to provide real-world protection for everyone. We’re dedicated to working with our partners around the world to continuously improve Android security and help you and your data stay safe.

<p>These three critical vulnerabilities impact Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance (CSA), an internet appliance designed to facilitate secure communication and management of devices over the internet. It serves as a bridge between the core server and managed devices, enabling them to communicate even when they are behind firewalls or using proxies.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>CVE-2024-9379 is an SQL injection flaw that a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges can trigger. CVE-2024-9380 is an OS command injection vulnerability that allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to achieve remote code execution. CVE-2024-9381 is a path traversal vulnerability that allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin privileges to bypass restrictions. In a recent advisory, Ivanti <a href="https://www.ivanti.com/blog/october-2024-security-update">disclosed</a> attackers' exploitation of CVE-2024- 9379, CVE-2024-9380, or CVE-2024-9381, chained with CVE-2024-8963. CISA also issued an <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/cisa-issues-urgent-advisory-on-critical-vulnerabilities-in-ivanti-products/">advisory</a> urging security teams to patch the flaws.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">CVE-2024-47176: CUPS</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This vulnerability impacts the Common Unix Printing System, an open-source printing system designed for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, providing a standardized framework for managing and controlling printers, enabling computers to act as print servers that accept print jobs from client machines, process them, and send them to the appropriate printer. Recently, researchers disclosed that threat actors can exploit vulnerabilities to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks with a 600x amplification factor. Under certain conditions, attackers can chain the set of vulnerabilities in multiple components of CUPS to execute arbitrary code remotely on vulnerable machines. Cyble researchers had <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/weekly-it-vulnerability-report-cyble-urges-fixes-for-nvidia-adobe-cups/">warned</a> about the CUPS vulnerability the previous week and reiterated the warning as new exploits emerged.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) identified a campaign called “ErrorFather” that utilized an&nbsp;undetected Cerberus Android Banking Trojan payload.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>ErrorFather employs a sophisticated infection chain involving multiple stages (session-based droppers, native libraries, and encrypted payloads), complicating detection and removal efforts.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>

<li>The campaign highlights how repurposed malware from leaks can continue to pose significant threats years after its original appearance.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Cerberus Android Banking Trojan initially emerged in 2019 and was available for rent on underground forums. It gained notoriety for its ability to target financial and social media apps by exploiting the Accessibility service, using overlay attacks, and incorporating VNC and keylogging features. Its widespread reach made it one of the most well-known banking trojans at the time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In 2020, following the leak of Cerberus' source code, a new variant called "Alien" appeared, leveraging Cerberus' codebase. Then, in 2021, another banking trojan called "<a href="https://cyble.com/blog/ermac-back-in-action/">ERMAC</a>" surfaced, also building on Cerberus' code and targeting over 450 financial and social media apps.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the beginning of 2024, a new threat known as the <a href="https://cryptax.medium.com/android-phoenix-authors-claims-sample-identification-and-trends-f199cbc9901d">Phoenix</a> Android Banking Trojan was discovered. Claiming to be a fresh botnet, Phoenix was found being sold on underground forums. However, it was identified as yet another fork of Cerberus, utilizing its exact source code, whereas Alien and ERMAC had introduced some modifications.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) recently uncovered several malicious samples posing as Chrome and Play Store apps. These samples use a multi-stage dropper to deploy a banking trojan payload, which was found to be leveraging the Cerberus Banking Trojan.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The identified sample “0c27ec44ad5333b4440fbe235428ee58f623a878baefe08f2dcdad62ad5ffce7” acts as a first-stage dropper application that drops and installs the final-signed.apk from assets, communicates with a Telegram Bot URL, and sends the&nbsp;device model, brand, and API version.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":67126,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Telegram Bot ID corresponds to the ErrorFather Bot, as shown in the figure below. Given the bot's name and the recent updates to this variant (covered in the Technical Analysis section), we are referring to this campaign as ErrorFather.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We have identified approximately 15 samples related to the ErrorFather campaign, including session-based droppers and their associated payloads. The first sample was detected in mid-September 2024, followed by a noticeable increase in samples during the first week of October 2024, with an active Command and Control (C&amp;C) server suggesting ongoing campaigns.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Multi-staged dropper</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The primary APK is a session-based dropper that contains a second-stage APK file named “final-signed.apk” within the Assets folder. It uses the Google Play Store icon and employs a session-based installation technique to install the APK from the assets, bypassing restricted settings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":67130,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-67130" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-4.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Figure 4 – Session-based dropper</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The second-stage dropper, "final-signed.apk," has a manifest file that requests dangerous permissions and services, but the code implementation is missing, indicating that the malware is packed. It includes a native file, "libmcfae.so," which is immediately loaded after installation to decrypt and execute the final payload.</p>

<p>The native file is responsible for handling the final payload. It uses the encrypted file “rbyypivsnw.png,” obtains the AES key and initialization vector (IV), performs decryption, and loads the “decrypted.dex” file at the location /data/data/suds.expend.affiliate.rising/code_cache/, as illustrated in the figure below.</p>

<p>The decrypted.dex file is the final payload, containing malicious functionalities such as keylogging, overlay attacks, VNC, PII collection, and the use of a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to create a Command and Control (C&amp;C) server. Notably, when submitted to VirusTotal, the decrypted.dex file was not flagged by any antivirus engine.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Based on the detection count, initially, we suspected it to be a fresh banking trojan, but upon deeper analysis of the final payload, we discovered significant code similarities with Cerberus. The TA behind the&nbsp;ErrorFather campaign had modified variable names, used more obfuscation, and reorganized the code, effectively evading detection despite Cerberus being identified in 2019.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Comparing the Cerberus sample and the more recent <a href="https://cryptax.medium.com/android-phoenix-authors-claims-sample-identification-and-trends-f199cbc9901d">Phoenix</a> botnet, we noticed changes in this recent variant of Cerberus used in the&nbsp;ErrorFather campaign, particularly in its C&amp;C structure. These differences suggest that the identified sample is a distinct malware variant.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use of DGA</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We observed the malware retrieving list of C&amp;C servers using two methods. First, after installation and establishing a connection with the main C&amp;C server, referred to by the TA as "PoisonConnect," the malware receives a list of four additional C&amp;C servers. It then stores these in the "ConnectGates" shared preferences setting, as shown in the figure below.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We observed a slight variation in the C&amp;C communication. Samples from the ErrorFather campaign solely use RC4 encryption to send a full JSON payload, including the action type. In contrast, earlier Cerberus samples utilized Base64 encoding combined with RC4, with the action type sent unencrypted via separate parameters. The figure below illustrates the C&amp;C communication for both the ErrorFather campaign and the earlier Cerberus samples.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Second, the malware incorporates a DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) that utilizes the Istanbul timezone to obtain the current date and time. It then generates MD5 and passes the digest to SHA-1 hash, appending one of four extensions: ".click", ".com", ".homes", and ".net". These generated domains are stored in the same "ConnectGates" setting. The figure below demonstrates the DGA used in the&nbsp;ErrorFather campaign.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://x.com/_CPResearch_/status/1603375823448317953">Alien</a> was observed similarly implementing a DGA process. However, unlike the&nbsp;ErrorFather campaign, it did not maintain a list of domains, used only the ".xyz" extension, and did not rely on a specific timezone.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The TA has renamed the "Actions" to "Types," as shown in Figure 11. These renamed types indicate the actions performed by the malware and the expected commands from the C&amp;C server. Upon analysis, we observed that the actions carried out by this malware closely resemble those seen in earlier Cerberus variants, with the primary difference being the renaming of action identifiers. Below is a comprehensive list of actions performed by the malware.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>During our malware analysis, we identified two keywords related to VNC: "StatusVNC" and "StatusHVNC." While HVNC implementation is absent in this campaign, it was previously present in the Phoenix botnet, a fork of Cerberus. VNC functionality is implemented using MediaProjection, along with a WebSocket connection to continuously transmit screen images and receive VNC actions from the Websocket response to interact with the device.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The overlay technique remains unchanged from the earlier Cerberus variant. The malware first sends the installed application package names list to identify potential targets. Once a target is identified, the server responds with the package names of the target applications. The malware then uses the "getFile" action to retrieve the HTML web injection page, as shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>The Cerberus malware used in the ErrorFather campaign can carry out financial fraud through VNC, keylogging, and overlay attacks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Cerberus Android Banking Trojan, first identified in 2019, became a prominent tool for financial fraud using VNC, keylogging, and overlay attacks. Following the leak of its source code, various threat actors repurposed the Cerberus code to develop new banking trojans, including Alien, ERMAC, and Phoenix. The ErrorFather campaign is another example of this pattern. While the TA behind ErrorFather has slightly modified the malware, it remains primarily based on the original Cerberus code, making it inappropriate to classify it as entirely new malware.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the ErrorFather campaign, the malware uses a multi-stage dropper to deploy its payload and leverages techniques such as VNC, keylogging, and HTML injection for fraudulent purposes. Notably, the campaign utilizes a Telegram bot named "ErrorFather" to communicate with the malware. Despite being an older malware strain, the modified Cerberus used in this campaign has successfully evaded detection by antivirus engines, further highlighting the ongoing risks posed by retooled malware from previous leaks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ErrorFather campaign exemplifies how cybercriminals continue to repurpose and exploit leaked malware source code, underscoring the persistent threat of Cerberus-based attacks even years after the original malware's discovery.</p>

As of now, this experiment is limited to a small number of users and websites, with the checkmarks appearing next to well-known companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Apple.

The blue checkmark serves as an indicator that the website is verified by Google.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When users hover over the checkmark, a message explains, “This icon is being shown because Google’s signals suggest that this business is the business that it says it is.” However, Google clarifies that this verification does not guarantee the full reliability of the website, meaning users should still exercise caution.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This feature resembles Google’s previous initiative, the BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) system, introduced in Gmail in 2023. BIMI uses blue markers to verify the authenticity of email senders, ensuring that businesses sending emails are legitimate and own the domains and logos they use.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The goal of BIMI was to combat phishing and other malicious activities by allowing users to quickly identify verified businesses.

While the checkmark feature is currently only being tested with a select group of users and websites, it has the potential to be expanded in the future.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If widely implemented, it could help users easily identify trusted websites directly from search results, offering an extra level of safety when browsing the internet.

Although it is unclear when or if Google plans to roll out the feature to all users, a company spokesperson confirmed that the test is underway.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This new experiment could be a step towards making the internet a safer space, particularly as users grow more concerned about online threats such as phishing and scams. For now, Google is monitoring the test to assess its effectiveness before deciding on a broader launch.</div>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The parents of a 19-year-old Connecticut honors student accused of taking part in a $243 million cryptocurrency heist in August were carjacked a week later &#8212; while out house-hunting in a brand new Lamborghini. Prosecutors say the couple was beaten and briefly kidnapped by six young men who traveled from Florida as part of a botched plan to hold the parents for ransom.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69159" style="width: 761px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69159" height="389" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/abc-7-danbury.png" width="751" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69159">Image: ABC7NY.  youtube.com/watch?v=xoiaGzwrunY</p></div>
<p>Late in the afternoon of Aug. 25, 2024 in Danbury, Ct., a married couple in their 50s pulled up to a gated community in a new Lamborghini Urus (investigators say the sports car still had temporary tags) when they were intentionally rear-ended by a Honda Civic.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=xoiaGzwrunY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">witness told police</a> they saw three men exit a van that was following the Honda, and said the men began assaulting the couple and forcing them into the van. Local police officers spotted the van speeding from the scene and pursued it, only to find the vehicle crashed and abandoned a short distance away.</p>
<p>Inside the disabled van the police found the couple with their hands and feet bound in duct tape, the man visibly bruised after being assaulted with a baseball bat. Danbury police soon reported arresting six suspects in the kidnapping, all men aged 18-26 from Florida. They also recovered the abandoned Lamborghini from a wooded area.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/borrero-diaz-et-al.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">criminal complaint</a> (PDF) filed on Sept. 24 against the six men does not name the victims, referring to them only as a married couple from Danbury with the initials <strong>R.C</strong>. and <strong>S.C.</strong> But prosecutors in Connecticut said they were targeted &#8220;because the co-conspirators believed the victims&#8217; son had access to significant amounts of digital currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>What made the Miami men so convinced R.C. and S.C.&#8217;s son was loaded with cryptocurrency? Approximately one week earlier, on Aug. 19, a group of cybercriminals that allegedly included the couple&#8217;s son executed a sophisticated phone-based social engineering attack in which they stole $243 million worth of cryptocurrency from a victim in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s according to<strong> ZachXBT</strong>, a frequently cited crypto crime investigator who <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1836753409749274895" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published a lengthy thread</a> that broke down how the theft was carried out and ultimately exposed by the perpetrators themselves.</p>
<p>ZachXBT&#8217;s post included <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1836753185718865979" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a screen recording</a> of a Discord chat session made by one of the participants to the $243 million robbery, noting that two of the people involved managed to leak the username of the Microsoft Windows PCs they were using to participate in the chat.</p>
<p>One of the usernames leaked during the chat was <strong>Veer Chetal</strong>. According to ZachXBT, that name corresponds to a 19-year-old from Danbury who allegedly goes by the nickname &#8220;<strong>Wiz,</strong>&#8221; although in the leaked video footage he allegedly used the handle &#8220;<strong>Swag</strong>.&#8221;  Swag was reportedly involved in executing the early stages of the crypto heist &#8212; gaining access to the victim&#8217;s Gmail and iCloud accounts.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69144" style="width: 759px;"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/veerchetal-windows.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-69144" height="415" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/veerchetal-windows.png" width="749" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69144">A still shot from a video screenshare in which one of the participants on the Discord voice chat used the Windows username Veer Chetal. Image: x.com/zachxbt</p></div>
<p>The same day ZachXBT published his findings, a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1369661/dl?inline" rel="noopener" target="_blank">criminal indictment</a> was issued in Washington D.C. charging two of the men he named as involved in the heist. Prosecutors allege <strong>Malone &#8220;Greavys&#8221; Lam</strong>, 20, of Miami and Los Angeles, and <strong>Jeandiel &#8220;Box&#8221; Serrano</strong>, 21, of Los Angeles conspired to steal and launder over $230 million in cryptocurrency from a victim in Washington, D.C. The indictment alleges Lam and Serrano were helped by other unnamed co-conspirators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lam and Serrano then allegedly spent the laundered cryptocurrency proceeds on international travel, nightclubs, luxury automobiles, watches, jewelry, designer handbags, and rental homes in Los Angeles and Miami,&#8221; reads <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/indictment-charges-two-230-million-cryptocurrency-scam" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a press release</a> from the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>.</p>
<p>By tracing the flow of funds stolen in the heist, ZachXBT concluded that Wiz received a large percentage from the theft, noting that &#8220;additional comfort [in naming him as involved] was gained as throughout multiple recordings accomplices refer to him as &#8216;Veer&#8217; on audio and in chats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A cluster of [cryptocurrency] addresses tied to both Box/Wiz received $41M+ from two exchanges over the past few weeks primarily flowing to luxury goods brokers to purchase cars, watches, jewelry, and designer clothes,&#8221; ZachXBT wrote.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from Veer Chetal, and from his parents &#8212; <strong>Radhika Chetal</strong> and <strong>Suchil Chetal</strong>. This story will be updated in the event that anyone representing the Chetal family responds. Veer Chetal has not been publicly charged with any crime.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.immaculatehs.org/discover-ihs/news/news-post/~board/mustang-monthly/post/mustang-moments-february-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news brief</a> published by a private Catholic high school in Danbury that Veer Chetal attended, in 2022 he successfully completed <strong>Harvard&#8217;s Future Lawyers Program</strong>, a &#8220;unique pre-professional program where students, guided by qualified Harvard undergraduate instructors, learn how to read and build a case, how to write position papers, and how to navigate a path to law school.&#8221; A <a href="https://patch.com/connecticut/danbury/immaculate-high-school-leads-pack-academics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">November 2022 story at patch.com</a> quoted Veer Chetal (class of 2024) crediting the Harvard program with his decision to pursue a career in law.</p>
<p>It remains unclear which Chetal family member acquired the 2023 Lamborghini Urus, which has a starting price of around $233,000. Sushil Chetal&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sushil-chetal-0898048/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> says he is a vice president at the investment bank <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>.</p>
<p>It is clear that other alleged co-conspirators to the $243 million heist displayed a conspicuous consumption of wealth following the date of the heist. ZachXBT&#8217;s post <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/malone-clubs.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank">chronicled Malone&#8217;s flashy lifestyle</a>, in which he allegedly used the stolen money to purchase more than 10 vehicles, rent palatial properties, travel with friends on chartered jets, and spend between $250,000 and $500,000 a night at clubs in Los Angeles and Miami.<span id="more-69000"></span></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69147" style="width: 730px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-69147 size-full" height="775" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/maloneclubs.png" width="720" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69147">In the photo on the bottom right, Greavys/Lam is the individual on the left wearing shades. They are pictured leaving a luxury goods store. Image: x.com/zachxbt</p></div>
<p><strong>WSVN-TV</strong> in Miami <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izUK7loTKKw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered an FBI raid</a> of a large rented Miami waterfront home around the time Malone and Serrano were arrested. The news station interviewed a neighbor of the home&#8217;s occupants, who reported a recent large party at the residence wherein the street was lined with high-end luxury vehicles &#8212; all of them with temporary paper tags.</p>
<p>ZachXBT unearthed a video showing a person identified as Wiz at a Miami nightclub earlier this year, wherein they could be seen dancing to the crowd&#8217;s chants while holding an illuminated sign with the message, &#8220;I win it all.&#8221;</p>
<div align="center"></div>
<p>It appears that all of the suspects in the cyber heist (and at least some of the alleged carjackers) are members of <strong>The Com</strong>, an archipelago of crime-focused chat communities which collectively functions as a kind of distributed cybercriminal social network that facilitates instant collaboration.</p>
<p>As documented in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month&#8217;s deep dive on top Com members</a>,  The Com is also a place where cybercriminals go to boast about their exploits and standing within the community, or to knock others down a peg or two. Prominent Com members are endlessly sniping over who pulled off the most impressive heists, or who has accumulated the biggest pile of stolen virtual currencies.</p>
<p>And as often as they extort and rob victims for financial gain, members of The Com are trying to wrest stolen money from their cybercriminal rivals — often in ways that spill over into <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/09/sim-swapper-abducted-beaten-held-for-200k-ransom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">physical violence in the real world</a>.</p>
<p>One of the six Miami-area men arrested in the carjacking and extortion plot gone awry &#8212; <strong>Reynaldo &#8220;Rey&#8221; Diaz</strong> &#8212; was shot twice while parked in his bright yellow Corvette in Miami&#8217;s design district in 2022. In <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/man-shot-while-sitting-in-high-priced-vehicle-in-miamis-design-district/2691038/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview</a> with a local <strong>NBC</strong> television station, Diaz said he was probably targeted for the jewelry he was wearing, which he described as &#8220;pretty expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has learned Diaz also went by the alias &#8220;<strong>Pantic</strong>&#8221; on Telegram chat channels dedicated to stealing cryptocurrencies. Pantic was known for participating in several much smaller cyber heists in the past, and spending most of his cut on designer clothes and jewelry.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_69146" style="width: 832px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69146" height="443" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/diazvette.png" width="822" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69146">The Corvette that Diaz was sitting in when he was shot in 2022. Image: NBC 6, South Florida.</p></div>
<p>Earlier this year, Diaz was &#8220;doxed,&#8221; or publicly outed as Pantic, with his personal and family information posted on a harassment and extortion channel frequented by members of The Com. The reason cited for Pantic&#8217;s doxing was widely corroborated by multiple Com members: Pantic had inexplicably robbed two close friends at gunpoint, one of whom recently died of a drug overdose.</p>
<p>Government prosecutors say the brazen daylight carjacking was paid for and organized by 23-year-old Miami resident <strong>Angel &#8220;Chi Chi&#8221; Borrero.</strong> In 2022, Borrero was arrested in Miami for <a href="https://miamidadefl.mugshots.zone/borrero-angel-mugshot-11-30-2022/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">aggravated assault with a deadly weapon</a>.</p>
<p>The six Miami men face charges including first-degree assault, kidnapping and reckless endangerment, and five of them are being held on a $1 million bond. One suspect is also charged with reckless driving, engaging police in pursuit and evading responsibility; his bond was set at $2 million. Lam and Serrano are each charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals hail from all walks of life and income levels, but some of the more accomplished cryptocurrency thieves also tend to be <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/fla-man-charged-in-sim-swapping-spree-is-key-suspect-in-hacker-groups-oktapus-scattered-spider/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">among the more privileged</a>, and from relatively well-off families. In other words, these individuals aren&#8217;t stealing to put food on the table: They&#8217;re doing it so they can amass all the trappings of instant wealth, and so they can boast about their crimes to others on The Com.</p>
<p>There is also a penchant among this crowd to call attention to their activities in conspicuous ways that hasten their arrest and criminal charging. In many ways, the story arc of the young men allegedly involved in the $243 million heist tracks closely to that of <strong>Joel Ortiz</strong>, a valedictorian who <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/02/more-alleged-sim-swappers-face-justice/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was sentenced in 2019 to 10 years in prison for stealing more than $5 million in cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p>Ortiz famously posted videos of himself and co-conspirators chartering flights and partying it up at LA nightclubs, with scantily clad women waving giant placards bearing their &#8220;OG&#8221; usernames &#8212; highly-prized, single-letter social media accounts that they&#8217;d stolen or purchased stolen from others.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p>Ortiz earned the distinction of being the first person convicted of SIM-swapping, a crime that involves using mobile phone company insiders or compromised employee accounts to transfer a target&#8217;s phone number to a mobile device controlled by the attackers. From there, the attacker can intercept any password reset links, and any one-time passcodes sent via SMS or automated voice calls.</p>
<p>But as the mobile carriers seek to <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/security/wireless-companies-want-another-year-for-sim-swap-compliance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">make their networks less hospitable to SIM-swappers</a>, and as more financial platforms seek to harden user account security, today&#8217;s crypto thieves are finding they don&#8217;t need SIM-swaps to steal obscene amounts of cryptocurrency. Not when tricking people over the phone remains such an effective approach.</p>
<p>According to ZachXBT, the crooks responsible for the $243 million theft initially compromised the target&#8217;s personal accounts after calling them as Google Support and using a spoofed number. The attackers also spoofed a call from account support representatives at the cryptocurrency exchange <strong>Gemini</strong>, claiming the target&#8217;s account had been hacked.</p>
<p>From there the target was social engineered over the phone into resetting multi-factor authentication and sending Gemini funds to a compromised wallet. ZachXBT says the attackers also convinced the victim to use <strong>AnyDesk</strong> to share their screen, and in doing so the victim leaked their private keys.</p>

<p><span style="color: black;">Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</span></p>

The new technologies were announced at the I/O 2024 event, with the main idea being to protect users' data and make possible recovery of the device in case it has been stolen. Read the breakdown of these new tools and how they work.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>How to Get Theft Protection on Android</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Features can be turned on in the Settings app by using the phrase "Theft protection" or in the "Personal &amp; device safety" section, found under the "All services" tab of the new Google services page. These three Theft Protection built-ins, writes the Theft Protection webpage, safeguard personal data if one's device is stolen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Theft Detection Lock</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The first one identifies unusual movement through the combination of sensors, Wi-Fi and smart device connectivity. If some person grabs an unlocked phone and runs away, Theft Detection Lock will automatically lock the screen so that no one can thereafter access private information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Offline Device Lock</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The second feature delivers security when there is no internet connection available. When someone attempts to lock tracking by turning off the internet on the device, this lock will have some conditions triggered, because the device was unlocked and in operation. The screen may be locked up to two times a day through this feature, adding protection to users in the case of theft.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Remote Lock via Website</b>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Remote Lock lets one lock their device from elsewhere using the webpage <a href="http://android.com/lock">android.com/lock</a> once a device is stolen. At this point, users are simply required to input a confirmed number and security challenge to lock the phone. It is at this point that Google advises users to use the feature on the device of a trusted person to access the lock screen easily. In many cases, it is said to work faster than "Find My Device".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Limited Testing and Availability</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">First tested in Brazil in early this year, these theft protection tools have begun rolling out to Android users around the world in lots of different brands including Pixel and Samsung. These features are still found on the beta version of Google Play services (24.40.33) and should reach the stable version soon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">New Theft Protection features from Google mark the advancement of device protection, especially for those whose main fears are stolen devices. As this comes up, users are strongly advised to turn to their settings to help make their devices safer than ever.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In these updates, it becomes clear that Google is doing its best to stay ahead of possible data losses and to minimise the effects brought about by theft incidents in a very digital age.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

The scheme is part of a wider investment scam known as "pig butchering," where fraudsters lure victims into investments by posing as romantic partners or financial advisors.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Victims are manipulated into losing funds, with scammers often requesting additional fees before disappearing with the money.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Group-IB, based in Singapore, noted that the campaign targets victims globally, with reports from regions like Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The fraudulent apps, created using the UniApp Framework, are labeled under "UniShadowTrade" and have been active since mid-2023, offering promises of quick financial gains.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One app, SBI-INT, even bypassed Apple’s App Store review process, giving it an illusion of legitimacy. The app disguised itself as a tool for algebraic formulas and 3D graphics calculations but was eventually removed from the marketplace.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The app used a technique that checked if the date was before July 22, 2024, and, if so, displayed a fake screen with mathematical formulas. After being taken down, scammers began distributing it via phishing websites for Android and iOS users.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For iOS, downloading the app involved installing a .plist file, requiring users to trust an Enterprise developer profile manually. Once done, the fraudulent app became operational, asking users for their phone number, password, and an invitation code.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After registration, victims went through a six-step process involving identity verification, providing personal details, and agreeing to terms for investments. Scammers then instructed them on which financial instruments to invest in, falsely promising high returns.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When victims tried to withdraw their funds, they were asked to pay additional fees to retrieve their investments, but the funds were instead stolen.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The malware also included a configuration with details about the URL hosting the login page, hidden within the app to avoid detection. One of these URLs was hosted by a legitimate service, TermsFeed, used for generating privacy policies and cookie consent banners.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Group-IB discovered another fake app on the Google Play Store called FINANS INSIGHTS, which had fewer than 5,000 downloads. A second app, FINANS TRADER6, was also linked to the same developer. Both apps targeted countries like Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, Thailand, and Cyprus.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Users are advised to be cautious with links, avoid messages from unknown sources, verify investment platforms, and review apps and their ratings before downloading.</div>

The campaign, dubbed “FakeUpdate,” has been linked to the SocGolish threat group, known for using compromised or fake websites to display deceptive update messages for popular applications like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Java.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When users fall for these fake update alerts and click on them, malicious software is installed on their systems instead of a legitimate update. This payload includes tools like info-stealers, remote access trojans (RATs), cryptocurrency drainers, and ransomware.

According to researchers from Gen Threat Labs, the WarmCookie backdoor being distributed in this campaign is more advanced than its previous versions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Initially discovered by cybersecurity firm eSentire in 2023, WarmCookie is designed to steal data, capture screenshots, run arbitrary commands, and drop additional malicious files. In this latest campaign, it has been updated with new features, such as the ability to run DLLs from a system’s temporary folder and execute PowerShell and EXE files.

The infection chain begins when users click on fake update prompts that closely mimic legitimate update notifications.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once clicked, a JavaScript file triggers the download of the WarmCookie installer, which bypasses security checks and installs the backdoor. The malware can evade detection through anti-virtual machine (anti-VM) checks, ensuring it’s not being monitored by security analysts before sending system data to its command and control (C2) server.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While the attackers are primarily using compromised websites to distribute these fake updates, researchers also identified malicious domains designed to look like official update sites, such as “edgeupdate[.]com” and “mozilaupgrade[.]com.”

Experts warn that legitimate browsers, including Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, update automatically and do not require users to manually download update files.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Any pop-up asking users to do so should be viewed with suspicion and avoided.</div>

Evidence from 2023 shows this trend: Microsoft detected 147,000 token replay attacks, marking a 111% increase year-over-year. Google reports that attacks on session cookies now rival traditional password-based threats.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Session hijacking has evolved from old Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, which relied on intercepting unsecured network traffic. Today, these attacks are internet-based, focusing on cloud apps and services. Modern session hijacking involves stealing session materials like cookies and tokens, enabling attackers to bypass standard security controls like VPNs, encrypted traffic, and even MFA.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The rise of identity-based attacks is a result of the growing complexity of user accounts, with each person managing multiple cloud-based services. Once attackers gain access to an active session, they can bypass MFA, leveraging the valid session tokens, which often stay active longer than expected.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Modern phishing toolkits, like AitM and BitM, make hijacking easier by allowing attackers to intercept MFA processes or trick users into controlling their browser. Infostealers, a newer tool, capture session cookies from the victim’s browser, putting multiple applications at risk, especially when EDR systems fail to detect them.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Infostealer infections are often traced back to unmanaged personal devices, which sync browser profiles with work devices, leading to the compromise of corporate credentials. EDRs aren’t always reliable in stopping these threats, and attackers can still resume stolen sessions without re-authentication, making it difficult for organizations to detect unauthorized access.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Passkeys offer some protection by preventing phishing, but infostealers bypass authentication entirely. While app-level controls exist to detect unauthorized sessions, many are inadequate. Companies are now considering browser-based solutions that monitor user agent strings for signs of session hijacking, offering a last line of defense against these sophisticated attacks.</div>

The app stayed active for several months before being discovered, according to a report from Check Point Research.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The app pretended to be a real crypto wallet service, tricking more than 10,000 users into downloading it. What made the scam effective was its professional appearance, which included consistent branding and fake positive reviews. These tactics helped the app rank high in Google Play’s search results, making it seem trustworthy to people looking for a secure place to store their cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once users installed the app, it was able to quietly drain funds from their wallets without being noticed right away. This case stands out because, up until now, most crypto wallet attacks have focused on desktop or browser-based platforms. This marks a shift, as cybercriminals are now targeting the growing number of people who use mobile platforms for crypto transactions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The app’s ability to avoid detection for such a long time shows how advanced cybercriminal tactics have become. It also highlights the need for greater caution among users when downloading apps, even from trusted platforms like Google Play.

This scam underscores the importance of stronger security measures for mobile transactions, such as using verified wallets and enabling two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It also calls attention to the need for better app screening by platforms like Google Play to prevent such scams from reaching users in the first place.

Though the amount stolen may seem small compared to other crypto thefts, this case is significant because it shows how cybercriminals are adapting to target mobile users as cryptocurrency becomes more popular.</div>

This blog delves into the intricacies of this malware, how it works, and its impact on cybersecurity.</div><p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Understanding the Necro Trojan</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The Necro Trojan, also known as Necro Python, is a versatile and highly adaptive piece of malware. Its primary strength lies in its modular architecture, allowing it to perform various<a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2019/09/camscanner-returns-after-being-removed.html" target="_blank"> malicious activities.</a>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These include displaying invisible ads, executing arbitrary code, and subscribing users to premium services without their consent. However, what sets the Necro Trojan apart is its use of steganography—a technique that involves hiding malicious code within seemingly innocuous files, such as images.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Role of Steganography</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Steganography is an ancient practice where hidden messages were concealed within other forms of communication. This technique has been repurposed in the digital age for more scandalous ends.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Necro Trojan is a complex, multi-stage <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/09/necro-malware-attacks-google-play-store.html" target="_blank">Android malware</a> that has managed to infiltrate both Google Play and unofficial app sources, impacting over 11 million devices. It targets popular apps such as Wuta Camera, Max Browser, and modified versions of Spotify, WhatsApp, and Minecraft.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Necro uses advanced evasion techniques, including obfuscation with OLLVM, steganography to conceal payloads in PNG images, and a modular architecture for versatility. The infection process begins with a loader that connects to C2 servers, often utilizing Firebase Remote Config.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Trojan’s plugins (NProxy, island, web, Happy SDK, Cube SDK, and Tap) perform various tasks, from creating tunnels through victim devices to manipulating ad interactions. Its self-updating capability and use of reflection to integrate privileged WebView instances within processes help it bypass security measures.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">How Necro Trojan Impacts Android Devices</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The scale of the Necro Trojan’s impact is staggering. With over 11 million Android devices compromised, the malware has demonstrated its ability to spread rapidly and efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consequences for affected users can be severe, ranging from unauthorized financial transactions to significant data breaches. Moreover, the Trojan’s ability to execute arbitrary code means that it can be used to deploy additional malware, further compounding the threat.</p>

Millions around the world use VPNs, and they are often promoted by influencers as essential tools for privacy. Their rise in popularity stems from the idea that they offer online privacy by hiding your browsing activities and making you anonymous on the internet.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Despite the marketing, the reality is less reassuring. VPN providers frequently fail to deliver the level of privacy and protection that users expect.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">How VPNs Work&nbsp;</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">A VPN works by channelling your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a VPN server. This prevents your internet service provider (ISP) from tracking your online activities, such as websites visited or apps used. However, this does not make you anonymous. Instead, it shifts the trust from your ISP to the VPN provider. This raises an important question: why trust a VPN provider more than your ISP?&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Trust Issues with VPN Providers&nbsp;</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">The truth is, that VPN providers cannot always be trusted. Free VPN services, in particular, are notorious for collecting and selling user data to third-party advertisers, posing privacy risks. Even paid VPN services, which claim to protect privacy by not logging data, have often been found to break those promises. In some cases, VPNs with “no-log” policies were later discovered storing data, which was leaked or shared with law enforcement.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Verifying Privacy Claims&nbsp;</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">A significant issue with VPN providers is the difficulty in verifying their privacy claims. Often, the only assurance users have is the provider’s word, and that’s rarely enough. Numerous VPN companies have been caught logging user data, breaking the trust they have established with their customers.&nbsp;</div><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><br />Setting Up Your Own&nbsp;</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">VPN

For those needing a VPN to bypass censorship or other specific purposes, experts recommend setting up a personal VPN server. By using services like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean, users can create and manage their own encrypted VPN server, giving them control of the private key to their data. This ensures that even the cloud provider cannot access your information.</div>

<title>Trends: Hardware gets AI updates in 2024</title>
<link>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/trends-hardware-gets-ai-updates-2024/</link>
<guid>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/trends-hardware-gets-ai-updates-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) usage over the past two and a half years has dramatically changed not only software but hardware as well. As AI usage continues to evolve, PC makers have found in AI an opportunity to improve end-user devices by offering AI-specific hardware and marketing them as &ldquo;AI PCs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Pre-AI hardware, adapted for AI</h2>
<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI</a> often depended on hardware that was not explicitly designed for AI. One example is graphics processors. Nvidia Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are crucial in AI because they handle parallel processing efficiently, which is necessary for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">machine learning</a> and deep learning. Their design enables simultaneous calculations, making them more effective than CPUs for AI model training and inference.</p>
<p>Another primary hardware type is the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Intel and other companies. An FPGA is an integrated circuit (IC) that can be reprogrammed multiple times. That flexibility makes it ideal for AI tasks. FPGAs accelerate deep learning and machine learning tasks. They provide hardware customization options that mimic the behavior of GPUs or ASICs.</p>
<p>FPGAs can be integrated with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch using tools like the Intel FPGA AI Suite and the OpenVINO toolkit.</p>
<p>FPGAs are used across the automotive, healthcare and other industries. They are useful in edge computing scenarios where AI capabilities must be deployed close to the data source for faster decision-making and reduced latency.</p>
<p>And yet another type is Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). One example is Google&rsquo;s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). TPUs are custom ASICs developed by Google to accelerate machine learning workloads. They are optimized for TensorFlow and used extensively in Google&rsquo;s data centers.</p>
<h2>How the generative AI revolution changed hardware</h2>
<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, changed the public&rsquo;s and industry&rsquo;s relationship with AI. ChatGPT quickly gained immense popularity, attracting more than one million users within five days of release. By January 2023, it had reached <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/chatgpt-and-the-race-to-secure-your-intellectual-property/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">100 million users</a>, making it the fastest-growing consumer application ever.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the runaway success of ChatGPT in the general culture changed venture funding in favor of AI startups. Big tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Meta accelerated the development and public availability of their offerings, and Silicon Valley quickly saw the emergence of companies like Anthropic and Perplexity offering <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI tools</a>.</p>
<p>Now, PC manufacturers are investing in AI-capable PCs that emphasize hybrid AI and on-device intelligence. The integration of AI into personal computers is facilitated by the emergence of specialized AI chipsets, such as neural processing units (NPUs), which enhance PCs&rsquo; ability to perform AI tasks locally.</p>
<p>This shift is expected to impact the PC market significantly. Some 60% of PCs shipped by 2027 will be AI-capable, <a href="https://canalys.com/reports/AI-PC-market-forecasts" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according to Canalys</a>.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://www.ibm.com/ai-cybersecurity?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&amp;mhq=AI%20cybersecurity">Explore AI cybersecurity solutions</a>
<h2>How do AI PCs differ?</h2>
<p>AI PCs are designed to efficiently execute AI workloads using a combination of CPUs, GPUs and NPUs, allowing them to handle tasks such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">generative AI</a> models more effectively than previous PC generations. This optimization enables AI PCs to run AI applications with improved performance, power efficiency and privacy by processing data locally rather than relying on cloud-based solutions.</p>
<p>Some criticize this category as a marketing gimmick and point out that many end users use generative AI through cloud-based chatbots.</p>
<p>Today, the public thinks of AI as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">large language models (LLMs)</a> running in the cloud and used as chatbots. Over time, the power and usage of AI by end users will increasingly take place via integrated features and AI-enhanced applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2nJsKvFcps" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According to Gartner Global Chief of Research Chris Howard</a>, AI will also involve more small language models (SLMs) powering non-chatbot use cases running close to the edge rather than the cloud.</p>
<p>AI processing will increasingly happen closer to the user and closer to the edge. And this means the trend of AI-specific hardware will only grow.</p>
<h2>Microsoft AI</h2>
<p>One standout is the introduction of Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot+ PCs, a new category of Windows PCs specifically designed for AI. These PCs feature new silicon capable of performing over 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS), providing all-day battery life and access to advanced AI models. The architecture of these devices integrates a high-performance NPU alongside the CPU and GPU, enhancing their AI capabilities. This configuration allows for new experiences such as real-time AI image generation, language translation and advanced search functionalities like the &ldquo;Recall&rdquo; feature, which records and analyzes device activity to improve user interaction with AI models.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also collaborated with major OEM partners, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, to bring these AI-enhanced devices to market.</p>
<h2>Apple AI</h2>
<p>Apple has made several hardware changes to accommodate and empower AI capabilities in its devices. A significant development is the integration of Apple silicon, specifically designed to handle advanced AI processing. This includes the use of specialized neural engines in devices like the iPhone 15 Pro, which are optimized for AI tasks such as machine learning and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">natural language processing</a>. These neural engines enhance the efficiency and speed of AI operations, enabling features like real-time language translation and image recognition.</p>
<h2>Google AI</h2>
<p>Google has made several changes to its hardware to accommodate AI. One of the significant steps includes developing and integrating its own hardware to support AI models like Gemini. This indicates a shift from relying on external chips to using proprietary technology to enhance AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Google has even reorganized its internal teams to integrate AI across its products better. This reorganization has led to the creation of a new Platforms and Devices team, consolidating various Google products like Pixel, Android, Chrome and ChromeOS under a single leadership. This move aims to accelerate AI integration and improve the synergy between hardware and software.</p>
<h2>The AI hardware revolution</h2>
<p>The popular generative AI revolution began in November 2022 and resulted in big hardware changes to accommodate power-hungry AI use cases. The recent accommodation of AI in hardware is just the beginning, no doubt. We can look forward to AI-specific hardware trickling down beyond PCs and phones and into wearables, Internet of Things devices and more.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Octo2, a new variant of the Octo mobile banking trojan, was <a href="https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/octo2-european-banks-already-under-attack-by-new-malware-variant">recently discovered</a> in European bank attacks, and deployment in other global regions is expected to follow.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Octo (also known as ExobotCompact) has emerged as one of the most prominent malware families in the mobile <a href="https://cyble.com/resources/research-reports/apt-threat-landscape-report-h1-2024/">threat landscape</a>, leading in the number of unique samples detected this year. Recently, a new variant named "Octo2," created by the original <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/">threat actor</a>, has been discovered, signaling a potential shift in the actors' tactics and strategies. This upgraded version enhances the malware’s remote action capabilities, particularly for Device Takeover attacks, ensuring greater stability in execution. New Octo2 campaigns have already been observed targeting several European countries.

They can support multilingual text production and vision apps like image recognition.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“This is our first open source, multimodal model, and it’s going to enable a lot of interesting applications that require visual understanding,” stated Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Llama 3.2 is based on the huge open source model Llama 3.1, which was released in late July. The previous Llama model was the largest open-source AI model in history, with 405 billion parameters (parameters are the adjustable variables within an AI model that help it learn patterns from data). The size shows the AI's ability to interpret and generate human-like text.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The new Llama models presented at Meta Connect 2024 are significantly reduced in size. Meta explained that they choose to develop smaller models because not all researchers have the required computational resources and expertise to run a model as large as Llama 3.1.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In terms of performance, Meta's new Llama 3.2 models compete with industry-leading systems from Anthropic and OpenAI. The 3B model exceeds Google's Gemma 2 2.6B and Microsoft's Phi 3.5-mini in tasks such as instruction following and content summarisation.

The 90B version, the largest of the models, surpasses both Claude 3-Haiku and GPT-4o-mini on a variety of benchmarks, including the widely used MMLU test, an industry-leading AI model evaluation tool.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>How to access Llama 3.2 models&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The new Llama 3.2 models are open source, so anyone can download and use them to power AI applications. The models can be downloaded straight from llama.com or Hugging Face, a popular open source repository platform. Llama 3.2 models are also available through a number of cloud providers, including Google Cloud, AWS, Nvidia, Microsoft Azure, and Grow, among others.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to figures published in early September, demand for Meta's Llama models from cloud customers increased tenfold between January and July, and is expected to rise much more in the wake of the new 3.2 line of models. Meta partner Together AI is providing free access to the vision version of Llama 3.2 11B on its platform till the end of the year.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Vipul Ved Prakash, founder and CEO of Together AI, stated that the new multimodal models will drive the adoption of open-source AI among developers and organisations.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“We’re thrilled to partner with Meta to offer developers free access to the Llama 3.2 vision model and to be one of the first API providers for Llama Stack,” Prakash noted. “With Together AI's support for Llama models and Llama Stack, developers and enterprises can experiment, build, and scale multimodal applications with the best performance, accuracy, and cost.”</span></div></span>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Attackers are increasingly turning to session hijacking to get around widespread MFA adoption. The data supports this, as:

147,000 token replay attacks were detected by Microsoft in 2023, a 111% increase year-over-year (Microsoft).&nbsp;
Attacks on session cookies now happen in the same order of magnitude as password-based attacks (Google).

But session hijacking isn’t a new technique – so

As the survey found, there has been a significant increase in professionals' concerns about data privacy; only 22% ranked it as their top concern at the beginning of 2023, and the number will rise to 72% by the end of 2024.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Technology is advancing at an exponential rate, and as a result, there is a growing awareness of its potential risks.



There has been a surge in concerns over data privacy caused by generative AI across several industries, according to a new report by Deloitte. Only 22% of professionals ranked it as among their top three concerns last year, these numbers have risen to 72% this year, according to a recent study.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There was also strong concern regarding data provenance and transparency among professionals, with 47% and 40% informing us that they considered them to be among their top three ethical GenAI concerns for this year, respectively. The proportion of respondents concerned about job displacement, however, was only 16%.



It is becoming increasingly common for staff to be curious about how AI technology operates, especially when it comes to sensitive data.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Almost half of security professionals surveyed by HackerOne in September believe AI is risky, with many of them believing leaks of training data threaten their networks' security.



It is noteworthy that 78% of business leaders ranked "safe and secure" as one of their top three ethical technology principles. This represents a 37% increase from the year 2023, which shows the importance of security to businesses today.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of Deloitte's 2024 "State of Ethics and Trust in Technology " report, the results of the survey were reported in a report which surveyed over 1,800 business and technical professionals worldwide, asking them to rate the ethical principles that they apply to technological processes and, specifically, to their use of GenAI.

It is becoming increasingly important for technological leaders to carefully examine the talent needs of their organizations, as they assist in guiding the adoption of generative AI. There are also ethical considerations that should be included on this checklist as well.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Deloitte report highlights the effectiveness of GenAI in eliminating the "expertise barrier": more people will be able to make more use of their data more happily and cost-effectively, according to Sachin Kulkarni, managing director, of risk and brand protection, at Deloitte. There may be a benefit to this, though as a result there may be an increased risk of data leaks as a result of this action."&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, there has been concern expressed about the effects of generative AI on transparency, data provenance, intellectual property ownership, and hallucinations among professionals. Even though job displacement is often listed as a top concern by respondents, only 16% of those asked are reporting job displacement to be true.

As a result of the assessment of emerging technology categories, business and IT professionals have concluded that cognitive technologies, which include large language models, artificial intelligence, neural networks, and generative AI, among others, pose the greatest ethical challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This category had a significant achievement over other technology verticals, including virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. However, respondents stated that they considered cognitive technologies to be the most likely to bring about social good in the future.

Flexential's survey published earlier this month found that several executives, in light of the huge reliance on data, are concerned about how generative AI tools can increase cybersecurity risks by extending their attack surface as a result, according to the report.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Deloitte's annual report, however, the percentage of professionals reporting that they use GenAI internally grew by 20% between last year and this year, reflecting an increase in the use of GenAI by their employees over the previous year.

94% of the respondents said they had incorporated it into their organization's processes in some way or another. Nevertheless, most respondents indicated that these technologies are either still in the pilot phase or are limited in their usage, with only 12% saying that they are used extensively.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Gartner research published last year also found that about 80% of GenAI projects fail to make it past proof-of-concept as a result of a lack of resources.

Europe has been impacted by the recent EU Artificial Intelligence Act and 34% of European respondents have reported that their organizations have taken action over the past year to change their use of AI to adapt to the Act's requirements.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to the survey results, however, the impact of the Act is more widespread, with 26% of respondents from the South Asian region changing their lifestyles because of it, and 16% of those from the North and South American regions did the same.

The survey also revealed that 20 per cent of respondents based in the U.S. had altered the way their organization was operating as a result of the executive order. According to the survey, 25% of South Asians, 21% of South Americans, and 12% of Europeans surveyed had the same perspective.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The report explains that "Cognitive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to provide society with the greatest benefits, but are also the most vulnerable to misuse," according to its authors.



The accelerated adoption of GenAI technology is overtaking the capacity of organizations to effectively govern it at a rapid pace. GenAI tools can provide a great deal of help to businesses in a range of areas, from choosing which use cases to apply them to quality assurance, to implementing ethical standards.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Companies should prioritize both of these areas."

Despite artificial intelligence being widely used, policymakers want to make sure that they won't get themselves into trouble with its use, especially when it comes to legislation because any use of it can lead to a lot of problems. 34% of respondents reported that regulatory compliance was their most important reason for implementing ethics policies and guidelines to comply with regulations, while regulatory penalties topped the list of concerns about not complying with such policies and guidelines.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A new piece of legislation in the EU, known as the Artificial Intelligence Act, entered into force on August 1. The Act, which takes effect today, is intended to ensure that artificial intelligence systems that are used in high-risk environments are safe, transparent, and ethical. If a company does not comply with the regulations, it could face financial penalties ranging from €35 million ($38 million), which is equivalent to 7% of global turnover, to €7.5 million ($8.1 million), which is equivalent to 1.5% of global turnover.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Over a hundred companies have already signed the EU Artificial Intelligence Pact, with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI among them; they have also volunteered to begin implementing the requirements of the bill before any deadlines established by law. Both of these actions demonstrate that they are committed to the responsible implementation of artificial intelligence in society, and also help them to avoid future legal challenges in the future.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The United States released a similar executive order in October 2023 with broad guidelines regarding the protection and enhancement of military, civil, and personal privacy as well as protecting the security of government agencies while fostering AI innovation and competition across the entire country. Even though this is not a law, many companies operating in the U.S. have made policy changes to ensure compliance with regulatory changes and comply with public expectations regarding the privacy and security of AI.</div>

Memory vulnerabilities in Android decreased from 76% six years ago to 24% now.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Role of Memory-Safe Programming</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Google, using memory-safe languages like Rust can help cut security risks in the codebase itself. The company has focused on safe code practices so that vulnerabilities do not occur in the first place, which has made this process of coding more scalable and cost-efficient over time. The more unsafe development reduces over time, memory-safe practices take up more space and render fewer vulnerabilities in total. As Jeff Vander Stoep and Alex Rebert of Google explained, the memory vulnerabilities tend to reduce even with new memory-unsafe codes being introduced. This is because vulnerabilities decay in time. Newer or recently modified code is more likely to carry issues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Google Goes for Rust</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In April 2021, the company announced that it was embracing Rust as a memory-safe language for Android development. The company has begun to concentrate on Rust for new development since 2019 and has continued to do so. Since then, memory safety flaws in Android went down from 223 in 2019 to less than 50 in 2024. Such a drastic downfall is partly due to proactive measures and improvement in discoverability tools such as those utilised with Clang sanitizers. Google also shifted its strategy from reactive patching to vulnerability prevention work by its security teams. They now focus on preventing issues before the problems crop up.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Safe Coding: The New Way</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google has learned that memory safety strategies must be evolved. The company abandoned older interventional methods like mitigations and fuzzing, instead opting for more secure-by-design principles. This type of principle allows for the embedding of security within the foundational blocks of coding, and it enables developers to construct code that-in itself-prevents vulnerabilities. This is called Safe Coding and lets Google safely make propositions regarding the code with its properties.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Combining Rust, C++, and Kotlin</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to promoting Rust, Google is also aiming to interface the language with other languages such as C++ and Kotlin. Thus, this practical solution allows doing memory-safe practices in ways that are pretty easy for today's needs by not rewriting older code completely. Making memory-safe languages incrementally, in itself, will eliminate entire categories of vulnerabilities and ensure all Android code is safer in the long term.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, the approach of Google is based on the presumption that as the number of vulnerabilities introduced decreased, the existing ones would automatically decrease over time. This change helps improve the design of security and scalability strategies concerning memory safety so they can be applied better to large systems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Partnership between Arm and a System for Better Security</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Related to this, Google has collaborated with Arm to further enhance the security of the GPU software and firmware stack across the Android ecosystem. The result was that the former identified several security issues in the code for it. Such were two memory problems in Pixel's driver - CVE-2023-48409 and CVE-2023-48421 - and a problem in the Arm Valhall GPU firmware, CVE-2024-0153. According to Google and Arm, proactive testing is a very key role to identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Future Prospects</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the future, Google aims to build a safer Android by maintaining its main focus on memory safety while pushing ahead its approach to security. The company's efforts in lessening vulnerabilities in memory, codification practice improvement, and collaboration with industry partners are targeted towards minimising memory leakage, thus ensuring long-term security solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This enhances the vulnerability of Android but also acts as a role model to other tech companies that should establish memory-safe languages and secure-by-design principles in their development processes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

According to recent reports, more than half of all companies suffer over 30% revenue loss annually due to fraudulent activities, with social media accounting for about 37% of these scams. This is alarming because even established tech giants like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google have fallen victim to these attacks. For smaller businesses, the threat is even greater as they often lack the robust security measures needed to fend off cyber threats effectively.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Phishing scams are among the most prevalent attacks on social media. Cybercriminals often create fake profiles that mimic company employees or business partners, tricking unsuspecting users into clicking on malicious links. These links can lead to malware installations or trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords or banking details. In some instances, fraudsters might also impersonate high-level executives to manipulate employees into transferring money or sharing confidential data.

Another common method is social engineering, where cybercriminals manipulate individuals into taking actions they otherwise wouldn’t.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For example, they might pretend to be company executives or representatives, convincing lower-level employees to share sensitive information, such as financial records or login credentials. This tactic is especially dangerous since it often appears as legitimate internal communication, making it harder for employees to recognize the threat.

Credential stuffing is another significant concern. In this form of attack, cybercriminals use stolen credentials from data breaches to gain unauthorized access to social media accounts. This can lead to spam, data theft, or the spread of malware through the company’s official accounts, jeopardizing both the business’s reputation and its customers’ trust.

Negative campaigns pose a different yet equally damaging threat.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Attackers may post false reviews, complaints, or misinformation to tarnish a company’s image, resulting in lost sales, reduced customer loyalty, and even potential legal costs if the business decides to pursue legal action. Such campaigns can have long-lasting effects, making it difficult for companies to rebuild their reputations.

Targeted advertising is another avenue for cybercriminals to exploit. They create deceptive ads that mislead customers or redirect them to malicious sites, damaging the company’s credibility and resulting in financial losses.

To safeguard against these threats, businesses must take proactive steps. Using strong, unique passwords for social media accounts is essential to prevent unauthorized access.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Responding quickly to any incidents can limit damage, and regular employee training on recognizing phishing attempts and social engineering tactics can reduce vulnerability. Managing access to social media accounts by limiting permissions to a select few employees can minimize risk. Additionally, regularly updating systems and applications ensures that security patches protect against known vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By implementing these preventive measures, businesses can better defend themselves against the growing threats posed by cybercriminals on social media, maintaining their reputation, customer trust, and financial stability.</div>

<title>Eliminating Memory Safety Vulnerabilities at the Source</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Jeff Vander Stoep - Android team, and Alex Rebert - Security Foundations<br /><br /></span>

<p>
Memory safety vulnerabilities remain a pervasive threat to software security. At Google, we believe the path to eliminating this class of vulnerabilities at scale and building high-assurance software lies in <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tackling-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-through-secure-by-design/">Safe Coding</a>, a secure-by-design approach that prioritizes transitioning to memory-safe languages.
</p>
<p>
This post demonstrates why focusing on Safe Coding for new code quickly and counterintuitively reduces the overall security risk of a codebase, finally breaking through the stubbornly high plateau of memory safety vulnerabilities and starting an exponential decline, all while being scalable and cost-effective.
</p>
<p>
We’ll also share updated data on how the percentage of memory safety vulnerabilities in Android dropped from 76% to 24% over 6 years as development shifted to memory safe languages.
</p>
<h1>Counterintuitive results</h1>


<p>
Consider a growing codebase primarily written in memory-unsafe languages, experiencing a constant influx of memory safety vulnerabilities. What happens if we gradually transition to memory-safe languages for new features, while leaving existing code mostly untouched except for bug fixes?
</p>
<p>
We can simulate the results. After some years, the code base has the following makeup<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as new memory unsafe development slows down, and new memory safe development starts to take over:
  
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhW_r-wkHYN6aB63fR5lu4p-qEIF-pNFRKcs_nAywuoJzETX4rvHd-MeazQZPlncOi8u485JHpYM59O-3nPOaPDaMjH5LLCqxHHb4edQV44EUgB7zjNI7EXKNA-zeFJHSc2IfYXq0KfE4ANyQhyphenhyphenzDHUq-ZMX4canzYr-1g1rBAhj2shn4zYoBSGJ1X9Fgkt/s1600/image9.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhW_r-wkHYN6aB63fR5lu4p-qEIF-pNFRKcs_nAywuoJzETX4rvHd-MeazQZPlncOi8u485JHpYM59O-3nPOaPDaMjH5LLCqxHHb4edQV44EUgB7zjNI7EXKNA-zeFJHSc2IfYXq0KfE4ANyQhyphenhyphenzDHUq-ZMX4canzYr-1g1rBAhj2shn4zYoBSGJ1X9Fgkt/s1600/image9.png" /></a></div>
  
</p>
<p>
In the final year of our simulation, despite the growth in memory-unsafe code, the number of memory safety vulnerabilities drops significantly, a seemingly counterintuitive result not seen with other strategies:
  
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhriISdaRMIrklNyxjeUgzdXXpuLm65UZ3BPXdpViHyy_NaHQ7rwlelqkT1Z70GRAf9144yuh4ADtes82mNOONZcbEFYivTIUrXvvWCZNvT2rDyK4ZkOU00qk_oaCTpSfVZTty4z4UqM6-Xr1tYjZbTJIvNTX0DBsRotJ0iTEztvZEoR7SSuQE1dde2p1jf/s1600/image3.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhriISdaRMIrklNyxjeUgzdXXpuLm65UZ3BPXdpViHyy_NaHQ7rwlelqkT1Z70GRAf9144yuh4ADtes82mNOONZcbEFYivTIUrXvvWCZNvT2rDyK4ZkOU00qk_oaCTpSfVZTty4z4UqM6-Xr1tYjZbTJIvNTX0DBsRotJ0iTEztvZEoR7SSuQE1dde2p1jf/s1600/image3.png" /></a></div>
  
</p>
<p>
This reduction might seem paradoxical: how is this possible when the quantity of new memory unsafe code actually grew?
</p>
<h1>The math </h1>


<p>
The answer lies in an important observation: <strong>vulnerabilities decay exponentially</strong>. They have a half-life. The distribution of vulnerability lifetime follows an exponential distribution given an average vulnerability lifetime &lambda;: 
  
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUTrTPtyvulXnZlxMEWF6rkSxoHRrNHjqhJ09jSUD_yf_3z-THg4n8oCY6b7YtEUIstSWNSOq8g4fPKLqu35A0n7lewRc1slBx07vI6KC341ItdBGJjmN0Zeq-L4Gc9f_mj2Gt9jtppMce2oI0U09dsFCIP49NECCe6XZMJdMu_kAU1G4Bsc2Xe-8VBCSg/s1600/Screenshot%202024-09-24%2011.00.53%20PM.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjUTrTPtyvulXnZlxMEWF6rkSxoHRrNHjqhJ09jSUD_yf_3z-THg4n8oCY6b7YtEUIstSWNSOq8g4fPKLqu35A0n7lewRc1slBx07vI6KC341ItdBGJjmN0Zeq-L4Gc9f_mj2Gt9jtppMce2oI0U09dsFCIP49NECCe6XZMJdMu_kAU1G4Bsc2Xe-8VBCSg/s1600/Screenshot%202024-09-24%2011.00.53%20PM.png" /></a></div>


</p>
<p>
A large-scale study of vulnerability lifetimes<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> published in 2022 in Usenix Security confirmed this phenomenon. Researchers found that the vast majority of vulnerabilities reside in new or recently modified code:
  
 <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiY1Fp0sUM3d7vOI11Kdae3wdsekNW_GqUdUL6LnhpjSS2cyKxvp_Dr4_N8AGVAf5VDmOAUbcMpXLLH2aYcfeszpY3hr1ttvRclMb3IWMvh9npCkY9Pc5v3jvcnJom80scnkfVBbikWLN-AcfFXSO03gEPiGDE6XSEftV6DBbUYD5HX1BQLnO0bB5-iGb0/s1600/image7.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgiY1Fp0sUM3d7vOI11Kdae3wdsekNW_GqUdUL6LnhpjSS2cyKxvp_Dr4_N8AGVAf5VDmOAUbcMpXLLH2aYcfeszpY3hr1ttvRclMb3IWMvh9npCkY9Pc5v3jvcnJom80scnkfVBbikWLN-AcfFXSO03gEPiGDE6XSEftV6DBbUYD5HX1BQLnO0bB5-iGb0/s1600/image7.png" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>
This confirms and generalizes our <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html">observation, published in 2021</a>, that the density of Android’s memory safety bugs decreased with the age of the code, primarily residing in recent changes.
</p>
<p>
This leads to two important takeaways:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>The problem is overwhelmingly with new code</strong>, necessitating a fundamental change in how we develop code.

<li><strong>Code matures and gets safer with time, exponentially</strong>, making the returns on investments like rewrites diminish over time as code gets older.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, based on the average vulnerability lifetimes, 5-year-old code has a 3.4x (using lifetimes from the study) to 7.4x (using lifetimes observed in Android and Chromium) lower vulnerability density than new code.
</p>
<p>
In real life, as with our simulation, when we start to prioritize prevention, the situation starts to rapidly improve.
</p>
<h1>In practice on Android</h1>


<p>
The Android team began prioritizing transitioning new development to memory safe languages around 2019. This decision was driven by the increasing cost and complexity of managing memory safety vulnerabilities. There’s much left to do, but the results have already been positive. Here’s the big picture in 2024, looking at total code:
  
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1OlXyuvF9q6o3VG9Rh4OSgrEvvlJZ0D_O5uW5lp-NhF8hSxDkY98ftEfwYvFQrAGp-ftnehqJ2RU17KDyfhgI3KjeFsmJyqGmL7n_Ip1SXAnza-NSqgrsJ47HOTluyzKAb_LCpwGHtVybKg9LNgRorEKWS2LIpqrnmcPIxLRPfW9ECK_XqSQ5fjrU2WhH/s1600/image5.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1OlXyuvF9q6o3VG9Rh4OSgrEvvlJZ0D_O5uW5lp-NhF8hSxDkY98ftEfwYvFQrAGp-ftnehqJ2RU17KDyfhgI3KjeFsmJyqGmL7n_Ip1SXAnza-NSqgrsJ47HOTluyzKAb_LCpwGHtVybKg9LNgRorEKWS2LIpqrnmcPIxLRPfW9ECK_XqSQ5fjrU2WhH/s1600/image5.png" /></a></div>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Despite the majority of code still being unsafe (but, crucially, getting progressively older), we’re seeing a large and continued decline in memory safety vulnerabilities. The results align with what we simulated above, and are even better, potentially as a result of our parallel efforts to improve the safety of our memory unsafe code. We first <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html">reported</a> this decline in 2022, and we continue to see the total number of memory safety vulnerabilities dropping<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Note that the data for 2024 is extrapolated to the full year (represented as 36, but currently at 27 after the <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-09-01">September security bulletin</a>).
  
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilTxSxGJLA-FakEzfrwOMTFJ8S03bJDn6Y61pKhtEAYV0oGXi1T_kVL48uU0ojZD9IwSXIQKL-duOtU1m4uEMsxNpvC3U9N_aynQ1XkrIkyFNve9Zj3FlbxJgcdrZaCSeKKJhYpEQM_NiMQDZduorxc8hgNJccpTX_VX3XYYV3uaQCwny7duVVDMNAHWHp/s1600/image8.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilTxSxGJLA-FakEzfrwOMTFJ8S03bJDn6Y61pKhtEAYV0oGXi1T_kVL48uU0ojZD9IwSXIQKL-duOtU1m4uEMsxNpvC3U9N_aynQ1XkrIkyFNve9Zj3FlbxJgcdrZaCSeKKJhYpEQM_NiMQDZduorxc8hgNJccpTX_VX3XYYV3uaQCwny7duVVDMNAHWHp/s1600/image8.png" /></a></div>
</p>
<p>
The percent of vulnerabilities caused by memory safety issues continues to correlate closely with the development language that’s used for new code. Memory safety issues, which accounted for 76% of Android vulnerabilities in 2019, and are currently 24% in 2024, well below the 70% industry norm, and continuing to drop.

</p>
<p>
As we noted in a <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/memory-safe-languages-in-android-13.html">previous post, </a>memory safety vulnerabilities tend to be significantly more severe, more likely to be remotely reachable, more versatile, and more likely to be maliciously exploited than other vulnerability types. As the number of memory safety vulnerabilities have dropped, the overall security risk has dropped along with it. 
</p>
<h1>Evolution of memory safety strategies</h1>


<p>
Over the past decades, the industry has pioneered significant advancements to combat memory safety vulnerabilities, with each generation of advancements contributing valuable tools and techniques that have tangibly improved software security. However, with the benefit of hindsight, it’s evident that we have yet to achieve a truly scalable and sustainable solution that achieves an acceptable level of risk:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1st generation: reactive patching.</strong> The initial focus was mainly on fixing vulnerabilities reactively. For problems as rampant as memory safety, this incurs ongoing costs on the business and its users. Software manufacturers have to invest significant resources in responding to frequent incidents. This leads to constant security updates, leaving users vulnerable to unknown issues, and frequently albeit temporarily vulnerable to known issues, which are getting exploited <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/time-to-exploit-trends-2021-2022/">ever faster</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2nd generation: proactive mitigating. </strong>The next approach consisted of reducing risk in vulnerable software, including a series of exploit mitigation strategies that raised the costs of crafting exploits. However, these mitigations, such as stack canaries and control-flow integrity, typically impose a recurring cost on products and development teams, often putting security and other product requirements in conflict:
</p>
<ul>

<li>They come with performance overhead, impacting execution speed, battery life, tail latencies, and memory usage, sometimes preventing their deployment.

<li>Attackers are seemingly infinitely creative, resulting in a cat-and-mouse game with defenders. In addition, the bar to develop and weaponize an exploit is regularly being lowered through <a href="https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/">better tooling</a> and other <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/06/project-naptime.html">advancements</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3rd generation: proactive vulnerability discovery.</strong> The following generation focused on detecting vulnerabilities. This includes <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers">sanitizers</a>, often paired with fuzzing like <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libfuzzer</a>, many of which were built by Google. While helpful, these methods address the symptoms of memory unsafety, not the root cause. They typically require constant pressure to get teams to fuzz, triage, and fix their findings, resulting in low coverage. Even when applied thoroughly, fuzzing does not provide high assurance, as evidenced by vulnerabilities found in extensively fuzzed code.
</p>
<p>
Products across the industry have been significantly strengthened by these approaches, and we remain committed to responding to, mitigating, and proactively hunting for vulnerabilities. Having said that, it has become increasingly clear that those approaches are not only insufficient for reaching an acceptable level of risk in the memory-safety domain, but incur ongoing and increasing costs to developers, users, businesses, and products. As highlighted by numerous government agencies, including CISA, in their <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/SecureByDesign_1025_508c.pdf">secure-by-design report</a>, "only by incorporating secure by design practices will we break the vicious cycle of constantly creating and applying fixes."
</p>
<h1>The fourth generation: high-assurance prevention</h1>


<p>
The shift towards memory safe languages represents more than just a change in technology, it is a fundamental shift in how to approach security. This shift is not an unprecedented one, but rather a significant expansion of a proven approach. An approach that has already demonstrated remarkable <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42934.pdf">success</a> in eliminating other vulnerability classes like XSS.
</p>
<p>
The foundation of this shift is <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3651621">Safe Coding</a>, which enforces security invariants directly into the development platform through language features, static analysis, and API design. The result is a secure by design ecosystem providing continuous assurance at scale, safe from the risk of accidentally introducing vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
The shift from previous generations to Safe Coding can be seen in the quantifiability of the assertions that are made when developing code. Instead of focusing on the interventions applied (mitigations, fuzzing), or attempting to use past performance to predict future security, Safe Coding allows us to make strong assertions about the code's properties and what can or cannot happen based on those properties.
</p>
<p>
Safe Coding's scalability lies in its ability to reduce costs by:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Breaking the arms race:</strong> Instead of an endless arms race of defenders attempting to raise attackers’ costs by also raising their own, Safe Coding leverages our control of developer ecosystems to break this cycle by focusing on proactively building secure software from the start.

<li><strong>Commoditizing high assurance memory safety:</strong> Rather than precisely tailoring interventions to each asset's assessed risk, all while managing the cost and overhead of reassessing evolving risks and applying disparate interventions, Safe Coding establishes a <a href="https://www.philvenables.com/post/raise-the-baseline-by-reducing-the-cost-of-control">high baseline of commoditized security</a>, like memory-safe languages, that affordably reduces vulnerability density across the board. Modern memory-safe languages (especially Rust) extend these principles beyond memory safety to other bug classes.

<li><strong>Increasing productivity</strong>: Safe Coding improves code correctness and developer productivity by shifting bug finding further left, before the code is even checked in. We see this shift showing up in important metrics such as rollback rates (emergency code revert due to an unanticipated bug). The Android team has observed that the rollback rate of Rust changes is less than half that of C++.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>From lessons to action</h1>


<h2>Interoperability is the new rewrite</h2>


<p>
Based on what we’ve learned, it's become clear that we do not need to throw away or rewrite all our existing memory-unsafe code. Instead, Android is focusing on making interoperability safe and convenient as a primary capability in our memory safety journey. Interoperability offers a practical and incremental approach to adopting memory safe languages, allowing organizations to leverage existing investments in code and systems, while accelerating the development of new features.
</p>
<p>
We recommend focusing investments on improving interoperability, as we are doing with
</p>
<p>
Rust ↔︎ C++ and Rust ↔︎ <a href="https://github.com/rust-diplomat/diplomat/pull/629">Kotlin</a>. To that end, earlier this year, Google provided a <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/02/improving-interoperability-between-rust-and-c.html">$1,000,000 grant</a> to the Rust Foundation, in addition to developing interoperability tooling like <a href="https://github.com/google/crubit">Crubit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/autocxx">autocxx</a>.
</p>
<h2>Role of previous generations</h2>


<p>
As Safe Coding continues to drive down risk, what will be the role of mitigations and proactive detection? We don’t have definitive answers in Android, but expect something like the following:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>More selective use of proactive mitigations</strong>: We expect less reliance on exploit mitigations as we transition to memory-safe code, leading to not only safer software, but also more efficient software. For instance, after removing the now unnecessary sandbox, <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-dev/c/UhwVDk4HZFA">Chromium's Rust QR code generator</a> is 95% faster.

<li><strong>Decreased use, but increased effectiveness of proactive detection</strong>: We anticipate a decreased reliance on proactive detection approaches like fuzzing, but increased effectiveness, as achieving comprehensive coverage over small well-encapsulated code snippets becomes more feasible.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Final thoughts</h1>


<p>
Fighting against the math of vulnerability lifetimes has been a losing battle. Adopting Safe Coding in new code offers a paradigm shift, allowing us to leverage the inherent decay of vulnerabilities to our advantage, <em>even in large existing systems</em>. The concept is simple: once we turn off the tap of new vulnerabilities, they decrease exponentially, making all of our code safer, increasing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16LZ6T-tcjgp3T8_N3m0pa5kNA1DwIsuMcQYDhpMU7uU/edit#slide=id.g3e7cac054a_0_89">effectiveness of security design</a>, and alleviating the scalability challenges associated with existing memory safety strategies such that they can be applied more effectively in a targeted manner.
</p>
<p>
This approach has proven successful in eliminating entire vulnerability classes and its effectiveness in tackling memory safety is increasingly evident based on more than half a decade of consistent results in Android.
</p>
<p>
We'll be sharing more about our secure-by-design efforts in the coming months.

<p>
     Simulation was based on numbers similar to Android and other Google projects. The code base doubles every 6 years. The average lifetime for vulnerabilities is 2.5 years. It takes 10 years to transition to memory safe languages for new code, and we use a sigmoid function to represent the transition. Note that the use of the sigmoid function is why the second chart doesn’t initially appear to be exponential.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a><li id="fn2">

<p>
     Unlike our simulation, these are vulnerabilities from a real code base, which comes with higher variance, as you can see in the slight increase in 2023. Vulnerability reports were unusually high that year, but in line with expectations given code growth, so while the percentage of memory safety vulnerabilities continued to drop, the absolute number increased slightly.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>

<h3>Who cares about GPUs?</h3>


<p>
You, me, and the entire ecosystem! GPUs (graphics processing units) are critical in delivering rich visual experiences on mobile devices. However, the GPU software and firmware stack has become a way for attackers to gain permissions and entitlements (privilege escalation) to Android-based devices. There are plenty of issues in this category that can affect all major GPU brands, for example, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4295">CVE-2023-4295</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-21106">CVE-2023-21106</a>, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-0884">CVE-2021-0884</a>, and more. Most exploitable GPU vulnerabilities are in the implementation of the GPU kernel mode modules. These modules are pieces of code that load/unload during runtime, extending functionality without the need to reboot the device.
</p>
<p>
Proactive testing is good hygiene as it can lead to the detection and resolution of new vulnerabilities before they’re exploited. It’s also one of the most complex investigations to do as you don’t necessarily know where the vulnerability will appear (that’s the point!). By combining the expertise of Google’s engineers with IP owners and OEMs, we can ensure the Android ecosystem retains a strong measure of integrity.  
</p>
<h3>Why investigate GPUs?</h3>


<p>
When researching vulnerabilities, GPUs are a popular target due to:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Functionality vs. Security Tradeoffs</strong>
<p>

    Nobody wants a slow, unresponsive device; any hits to GPU performance could result in a noticeably degraded user experience. As such, the GPU software stack in Android relies on an <strong>in-process HAL model</strong> where the API & user space drivers communicating with the GPU kernel mode module are running directly within the context of apps, thus avoiding IPC (interprocess communication). This opens the door for potentially untrusted code from a third party app being able to directly access the interface exposed by the GPU kernel module. If there are any vulnerabilities in the module, the third party app has an avenue to exploit them. As a result, a potentially untrusted code running in the context of the third party application is able to directly access the interface exposed by the GPU kernel module and exploit potential vulnerabilities in the kernel module. 
</p>
<p>

<li><strong>Variety & Memory Safety</strong>
<p>

    Additionally, the implementation of GPU subsystems (and kernel modules specifically) from major OEMs are increasingly complex. Kernel modules for most GPUs are typically written in memory unsafe languages such as C, which are susceptible to memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflow.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Can someone do something about this?</h3>


<p>
Great news, we already have! Who’s we? The Android Red Team and Arm! We’ve worked together to run an engagement on the Mali GPU (more on that below), but first, a brief introduction:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Android Red Team</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Android Red Team performs time-bound security assessment engagements on all aspects of the Android open source codebase and conducts regular security reviews and assessments of internal Android components. Throughout these engagements, the Android Red Team regularly collaborates with 3rd party software and hardware providers to analyze and understand proprietary and “closed source” code repositories and relevant source code that are utilized by Android products with the sole objective to identify security risks and potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by adversaries outside of Android. This year, the Android Red Team collaborated directly with our industry partner, Arm, to conduct the Mali GPU engagement and further secure millions of Android devices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arm Product Security and GPU Teams</strong>
</p>
<p>
Arm has a central product security team that sets the policy and practice across the company. They also have dedicated product security experts embedded in engineering teams. Arm operates a systematic approach which is designed to prevent, discover, and eliminate security vulnerabilities. This includes a Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), a Monitoring capability, and Incident Response. For this collaboration the Android Red Teams were supported by the embedded security experts based in Arm’s GPU engineering team.
</p>
<h3>Working together to secure Android devices</h3>


<p>
Google’s Android Security teams and Arm have been working together for a long time. Security requirements are never static, and challenges exist with all GPU vendors. By frequently sharing expertise, the Android Red Team and Arm were able to accelerate detection and resolution. Investigations of identified vulnerabilities, potential remediation strategies, and hardening measures drove detailed analyses and the implementation of fixes where relevant.
</p>
<p>
Recent research focused on the Mali GPU because it is the most popular GPU in today's Android devices. Collaborating on GPU security allowed us to:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Assess the impact on the broadest segment of the Android Ecosystem</strong>: The Arm Mali GPU is one of the most used GPUs by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and is found in many popular mobile devices. By focusing on the Arm Mali GPU, the Android Red Team could assess the security of a GPU implementation running on millions of Android devices worldwide.

<li><strong>Evaluate the reference implementation and vendor-specific changes: </strong>Phone manufacturers often modify the upstream implementation of GPUs. This tailors the GPU to the manufacturer's specific device(s). These modifications and enhancements are always challenging to make, and can sometimes introduce security vulnerabilities that are not present in the original version of the GPU upstream. In this specific instance, the Google Pixel team actively worked with the Android Red Team to better understand and secure the modifications they made for Pixel devices.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Improvements</h3>


<p>
Investigations have led to significant improvements, leveling up the security of the GPU software/firmware stack across a wide segment of the Android ecosystem.
</p>
<h2>Testing the kernel driver</h2>


<p>
One key component of the GPU subsystem is its kernel mode driver. During this engagement, both the Android Red Team and Arm invested significant effort looking at the Mali kbase kernel driver. Due to its complexity, fuzzing was chosen as the primary testing approach for this area. Fuzzing automates and scales vulnerability discovery in a way not possible via manual methods. With help from Arm, the Android Red Team added more syzkaller fuzzing descriptions to match the latest Mali kbase driver implementation. 
</p>
<p>
The team built a few customizations to enable fuzzing the Mali kbase driver in the cloud, without physical hardware. This provided a huge improvement to fuzzing performance and scalability. With the Pixel team’s support, we also were able to set up fuzzing on actual Pixel devices. Through the combination of cloud-based fuzzing, Pixel-based fuzzing, and manual review, we were able to uncover two memory issues in Pixel’s customization of driver code (CVE-2023-48409 and CVE-2023-48421). 
</p>
<p>
Both issues occurred inside of the gpu_pixel_handle_buffer_liveness_update_ioctl function, which is implemented by the Pixel team as part of device specific customization. These are both memory issues caused by integer overflow problems. If exploited carefully alongside other vulnerabilities, these issues could lead to kernel privilege escalation from user space.  Both issues were fixed and the patch was released to affected devices in <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2023-12-01">Pixel security bulletin 2023-12-01</a>.
</p>
<h2>Testing the firmware</h2>


<p>
Firmware is another fundamental building block of the GPU subsystem. It’s the intermediary working with kernel drivers and GPU hardware. In many cases, firmware functionality is directly/indirectly accessible from the application. So “application ⇒ kernel ⇒ firmware ⇒ kernel” is a known attack flow in this area. Also, in general, firmware runs on embedded microcontrollers with limited resources. Commonly used security kernel mitigations (ASLR, stack protection, heap protection, certain sanitizers, etc.) might not be applicable to firmware due to resource constraints and performance impact. This can make compromising firmware easier, in some cases, than directly compromising kernel drivers from user space. To test the integrity of existing firmware, the Android Red Team and Arm worked together to perform both fuzzing and formal verification along with manual analysis. This multi-pronged approach led to the discovery of CVE-2024-0153, which had a patch released in <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-07-01">the July 2024 Android Security Bulletin</a>.
</p>
<p>
CVE-2024-0153 happens when GPU firmware handles certain instructions. When handling such instructions, the firmware copies register content into a buffer. There are size checks before the copy operation. However, under very specific conditions, an out-of-bounds write happens to the destination buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. When carefully manipulated, this overflow will overwrite some other important structures following the buffer, causing code execution inside of the GPU firmware. 
</p>
<p>
The conditions necessary to reach and potentially exploit this issue are very complex as it requires a deep understanding of how instructions are executed. With collective expertise, the Android Red Team and Arm were able to verify the exploitation path and leverage the issue to gain limited control of GPU firmware. This eventually circled back to the kernel to obtain privilege escalation. Arm did an excellent job to respond quickly and remediate the issue. Altogether, this highlights the strength of collaboration between both teams to dive deeper.
</p>
<h3>Time to Patch</h3>


<p>
It’s known that attackers exploit GPU vulnerabilities in the wild, and time to patch is crucial to reduce risk of exploitation and protect users. As a result of this engagement, nine new Security Test suite (<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/test/sts-sdk">STS</a>) tests were built to help partners automatically check their builds for missing Mali kbase patches. (Security Test Suite is software provided by Google to help partners automate the process of checking their builds for missing security patches.)
</p>
<h3>What’s Next?</h3>


<p>
The Arm Product Security Team is actively involved in security-focused industry communities and collaborates closely with its ecosystem partners. The engagement with the Android Red Team, for instance, provides valuable enablement that drives best practices and product excellence. Building on this collaborative approach, Arm is complementing its product security assurance capabilities with a bug bounty program. This investment will expand Arm’s efforts to identify potential vulnerabilities. For more information on Arm's product security initiatives, please visit this <a href="https://www.arm.com/products/product-security" target="_blank">product security page</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Android Red Team and Arm continue to work together to proactively raise the bar on GPU security. With thorough testing, rapid fixing, and updates to the security test suite, we’re improving the ecosystem for Android users. The Android Red Team looks forward to replicating this working relationship with other ecosystem partners to make devices more secure.

As a result of an investigation by the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, more reported ransomware attacks against targets in the health-care industry last year compared to any other sector it monitors, including six others.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In addition to explaining the legal predicaments for healthcare organizations that are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals, the Lehigh Valley case highlights the legal risks healthcare organizations may face in dealing with cybercriminals as well as complaints brought by patients whose lives have been ruined by a breach.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">More than 600 of these patients had their medical records hacked, resulting in the theft and publication of images from those records, including photos of themselves in nude.

This Settlement settlement consists of a payment ranging from $50 to $70,000 for each Settlement Class member, with the maximum payment going to those who had their nude photos published online as part of the settlement. A distribution of the money is estimated to be made in the early part of next year by the attorneys.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A data breach occurred according to the lawsuit on February 6, 2023, and the lawsuit claims that the breach exposed personally identifiable information and protected health information, including an individual's address, an email address, a social security number, a passport number, a driver's license number/state identification number, their health insurance provider, their medical diagnosis and treatment information, their medications, their lab results, and their nude photographs.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There was an incident of data breaches that were later revealed as the work of the cyber-hacker group ALPHV, or BlackCat in the case of the computer virus. ALPHV gained notoriety after one of its cyberattacks was identified against an academic institution and a healthcare establishment.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Dark web authorities have reported that about 132 gigabytes of information have been uploaded to the site.

If LHVN had not paid the ransom demanded by the hackers, the data breach would have resulted in the release of sensitive information to the public. The corporation LVHN did not pay the ransom despite knowing about it, but the images were released after the payment was made.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to the lawsuit, LVHN has put its own "financial interests" above the best interest of its patient's health to achieve financial success.

Accordingly, the lawsuit can be argued that the class, including a plaintiff identified as only Jane Doe in the lawsuit, has suffered embarrassment and humiliation as a result of this action.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It has also been revealed that Doe will receive a larger portion of the settlement money than the rest of the class, according to Saltz Mongeluzzi Bendesky, the law firm that represents the class. A health system executive called patients to inform them of the breach after they discovered it in February 2023. The executive said that hackers had posted their personal information on the dark web - including nude photos - and that it was not accessible through conventional search engines like Google - which is a collection of hidden websites.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is the description of the executive who apologized for the behaviour of the woman in her 50s, along with the offer of two years of credit monitoring, which the woman accepted with a chuckle. In the lawsuit, the cancer patient says that she was completely in disbelief that the health system had stored nude photos of her on its computer network. She was in complete disbelief at the time of the incident.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Approximately 135,000 patients, health-system employees, and others involved in the breach will receive a payout as part of the proposed settlement, which still requires a judge's approval. However, according to the agreement, there will be 80 per cent of the settlement money earmarked for the victims whose nude photos were published on the dark web to compensate them.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is estimated that roughly 600 men and women fall into this category, and each will receive at least $75,000, says Howard. There is a possibility that Jane Doe, as the lead plaintiff, can receive $125,000 as a settlement.</div>

Without DNS, accessing websites would be far more complicated, requiring users to remember lengthy strings of numbers instead of simple names like “google.com.”

When you enter a website URL into your browser, the DNS process begins. This request, known as a “DNS query,” first goes to a DNS resolver—typically provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a third-party DNS service like Google Public DNS or Cloudflare.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The resolver acts as an intermediary, starting the process to find the corresponding IP address of the domain name you’ve entered.

The DNS resolver contacts one of the 13 root servers that make up the top level of the DNS hierarchy. These servers don’t hold the IP address themselves but provide information about which “Top-Level Domain” (TLD) server to query next. The TLD server is specific to the domain extension you’ve entered (e.g., “.com,” “.net,” “.org”) and points the resolver to the authoritative name server responsible for the particular website. The authoritative name server then provides the IP address back to the resolver, which, in turn, sends it to your browser.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The browser then connects to the web server using this IP address, loading the website you want to visit. This process, though complex, happens in milliseconds.

Security is a vital aspect of DNS because it is a frequent target for cyberattacks. One common threat is DNS spoofing, where attackers redirect traffic to fraudulent websites to steal data or spread malware. DNS hijacking is another risk, where hackers manipulate DNS records to divert users to malicious sites. These threats emphasize the importance of DNS security protocols like DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT), which encrypt DNS requests to prevent interception by malicious entities, thus protecting users’ data and privacy.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Switching to a third-party DNS service can enhance your internet experience in terms of speed, reliability, and security. Services like Google Public DNS, OpenDNS, or Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 offer faster query response times, better privacy protection, and can help circumvent geographical restrictions imposed by ISPs. These alternatives often provide built-in security features, such as blocking malicious sites, to offer an extra layer of protection.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">DNS is the backbone of internet browsing, seamlessly converting domain names into IP addresses. By understanding its role and the importance of security measures, users can better appreciate how DNS keeps the internet functional and secure. Whether ensuring that websites load correctly or protecting against cyber threats, DNS plays an indispensable role in our everyday online activities.</div>

Companies are trying to collect as much as possible to sell it to third-party data brokers. Cybercrime is growing steadily and targeting unsuspecting victims. Addressing both issues is one of the reasons the more mindful browser, Brave, is integrating an array of features to keep data secure and private.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another feature that differentiates Brave is that it has a built-in use of Brave Shields- the application engaged in blocking harmful elements that may track the behaviour of your browsing. In other types of browsers, users have to install third-party ad blockers. Brave Shields are installed directly in the browser and prevent intrusive ads and trackers from retrieving data regarding the activities you perform online.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It also solves a very common problem with ad blockers, which is that some websites break when the ads are blocked. To solve this issue, Brave replaces tracking codes with privacy-friendly alternatives while ensuring that the integrity of the webpage is maintained and your data is kept secure. As companies continue to devise new ways to hide trackers, Brave is countering this through CNAME uncloaking techniques by uncovering such hidden threats before they manage to collect data from you.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Blocking Cross-Site Cookies</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cookies are small files that download onto your computer, which track your surfing and, more often than not, targeted advertisements will follow you around the web. Cross-site cookies are blocked, by default, on Brave so websites cannot track movements from one site to the other. Brave provides temporary cookies for functionality, though without exposing any private data, for the occasional cookie-dependent website.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Phishing Protection with Google Safe Browsing</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though it puts much emphasis on privacy, Brave remembers security. It uses Google Safe Browsing, which won't enable a user to reach a phishing site or download harmful files. Being built upon Chromium, the same platform that Google Chrome runs on, Brave ensures users protection from known threats to their developers, hence making browsing safer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While Google Safe Browsing is a service that compromises privacy within Google Chrome, it only serves Brave to block harmful websites without the collection of any personal data from browsing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A Search Engine Respecting Your Privacy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most search engines log your search history, accumulating information about the queries you made and selling that information to customise ads or even sell. In contrast, Brave Search does not collect, store, or share search queries when accessed through the browser. This is a completely private browser that does not believe in logging and selling your browsing habits. Additionally, Brave Search serves less biased results because it crawls the web itself rather than prioritising by SEO schemes or the behaviour of prior users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage of Brave Search is that it can be utilised independently of the download of the Brave browser – so anyone can have private searches.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Inbuilt VPN and Firewall</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It also has a built-in VPN and firewall from Brave, that's available on free trial for seven days, after which you can subscribe to it at $9.99 a month. This will ensure your activity is completely hidden from all the potential threats looking at you, and you won't let any malicious content get inside or leave your network. A VPN encrypts internet traffic so nobody can track your activity online, while the firewall keeps unwanted data from appearing in your system.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It's probably refreshing about Brave, considering it is committed to protecting personal data. Most companies have either policies or strategies that collect and sell a user's data. With Brave, what is striking is the no-sharing policy, full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and as such, all users' benefit from strong data protection law, irrespective of their region.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For people who place importance on privacy and safety, Brave is a full answer. This is because the provider separates itself from the rest of the browsers by its focus on protecting the user from risks connected with the misuse of data or cybercrime through features like Brave Shields, cross-site cookie blocking, private search options, and built-in VPN and firewall services. These have extended to ensure that your web experience remains secure and private; from stopping trackers, malicious websites, and unwanted ads.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

<p>All identified spyware samples were observed communicating with the same Command and Control (C&amp;C) server hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket: <strong>hxxps://phone-books[.]s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/</strong>. Our analysis revealed that the stolen data, including contacts, SMS messages, images, and videos, was openly stored in the S3 bucket (C&amp;C server), further confirming that the malware specifically targeted individuals in South Korea.</p>

<p>After installation, all spyware samples display a single screen with a message in Korean tailored to the app's theme.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":63088,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63088" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Figure-8-–-Screen-loaded-upon-installation-1024x397.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Figure 8 – Screen loaded upon installation</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The source code of this spyware is relatively simple. It utilizes a minimal set of permissions, including “READ_SMS,” “READ_CONTACTS,” and “READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,” to carry out its malicious operations. The manifest file specifies only the main activity, which triggers the malicious functionality upon execution.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":63089,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63089" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Figure-9-–-Manifest-file-1024x492.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Figure 9 – Manifest file</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Upon installation, the spyware requests the necessary permissions; once granted, it executes its malicious functions. These functions, responsible for collecting data from the infected device, are executed within the API method “onRequestPermissionsResult”, as illustrated in the image below.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":63090,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63090" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Figure-10-–-Malware-executing-malicious-functions-in-onRequestPermissionResult-method-1024x516.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Figure 10 – Malware executing malicious functions in onRequestPermissionResult method</em></figcaption></figure>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To exfiltrate images and videos, the malware queries the device's content provider and uploads each file to the C&amp;C server via the endpoint “/media/+filename”. This behavior is evident in the exposed data, as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The malware gathers contacts and SMS messages from the infected device and stores them in two separate files: phone.json for contacts and sms.json for SMS data. These files are then transmitted to the C&amp;C server, as demonstrated in the figure below.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This campaign highlights the growing sophistication of Android spyware targeting individuals in South Korea. By utilizing an Amazon AWS S3 bucket for Command and Control infrastructure, the <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/" title="threat actors">threat actors</a> were able to maintain stealth and evade detection for an extended period. This spyware strain utilizes a minimalist approach—leveraging only a few key permissions to exfiltrate sensitive data such as contacts, SMS messages, images, and videos—and demonstrates how even simple malware can be extremely effective.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is concerning that attackers are increasingly turning to trusted cloud services like AWS as part of their malicious infrastructure. This tactic allows them to bypass traditional security measures and stay under the radar.</p>

<title>A new path for Kyber on the web</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/a-new-path-for-kyber-on-web.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/a-new-path-for-kyber-on-web.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by David Adrian, David Benjamin, Bob Beck & Devon O'Brien, Chrome Team</span>

<p>
We previously posted about <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html">experimenting</a> with a hybrid post-quantum key exchange, and <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/advancing-our-amazing-bet-on-asymmetric.html">enabling it</a> for 100% of Chrome Desktop clients. The hybrid key exchange used both the pre-quantum X25519 algorithm, and the new post-quantum algorithm Kyber. At the time, the NIST standardization process for Kyber had not yet finished.
</p>
<p>
Since then, the Kyber algorithm has been standardized with minor technical changes and renamed to the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html">Module Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism</a> (ML-KEM). We have implemented ML-KEM in Google’s cryptography library, <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl">BoringSSL</a>, which allows for it to be deployed and utilized by services that depend on this library.
</p>
<p>
The changes to the final version of ML-KEM make it incompatible with the previously deployed version of Kyber.  As a result, the codepoint in TLS for hybrid post-quantum key exchange is changing from 0x6399 for Kyber768+X25519, to 0x11EC for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem/02/">ML-KEM768+X25519</a>. To handle this, we will be making the following changes in Chrome 131<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Chrome will switch from supporting Kyber to ML-KEM

<li>Chrome will offer a key share prediction for hybrid ML-KEM (codepoint 0x11EC)

<li>The PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled flag and <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#PostQuantumKeyAgreementEnabled">enterprise policy</a> will apply to both Kyber and ML-KEM

<li>Chrome will no longer support hybrid Kyber (codepoint 0x6399)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Chrome will not support Kyber and ML-KEM at the same time. We made this decision for several reasons:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Kyber was always experimental, so we think continuing to support it risks ossification on non-standard algorithms.

<li>Post-quantum cryptography is <a href="https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/pqc-signatures-2024/">too big</a> to be able to offer two post-quantum key share predictions at the same time.

<li>Server operators can temporarily support both algorithms at the same time to maintain post-quantum security with a broader set of clients, as they update over time.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We do not want to regress any clients’ post-quantum security, so we are waiting until Chrome 131 to make this change so that server operators have a chance to update their implementations.
</p>
<p>
Longer term, we hope to avoid the chicken-and-egg problem for post-quantum key share predictions through our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-key-share-prediction/">emerging IETF draft for key share prediction</a>. This allows servers to broadcast what algorithms they support in DNS, so that clients can predict a key share that a server is known to support. This avoids the risk of an extra round trip, which can be particularly costly when using large post-quantum algorithms.
</p>
<p>
We’re excited to continue to improve security for Chrome users, against both current and future computers.

Researchers warned that attackers might use that vulnerability to obtain encrypted credentials, which would give them illegal access to the program and possibly allow them to go to other areas of the network.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In July, cybersecurity company Group-IB revealed that, only a few weeks after its public release, groups like EstateRansomware appear to have begun concentrating on CVE-2023-27532. The United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added CVE-2023-27532 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogue in August of last year.</span></div></span>

<title>Bitcoin ATM Emerges as Major Threat to Cryptocurrency</title>

<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9WP1fgQToKyfzIaQi4khvIn6ZLMsjRjxrkzlV8elb1qFzp9XCrCZauURZNUVk1DsGF05kmSlTu4nioNGG4d_vW5lB6khqOQzrLdHdvlUUwkZj3G7CEr5m9nXtPLlPzvebVSHbHSOh7rxVjCH0baQMRlX5TWLQMH74pmnuIFRiZVIfwffa6cL32t5sVE5Y/s8000/bitcoin-3089728.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9WP1fgQToKyfzIaQi4khvIn6ZLMsjRjxrkzlV8elb1qFzp9XCrCZauURZNUVk1DsGF05kmSlTu4nioNGG4d_vW5lB6khqOQzrLdHdvlUUwkZj3G7CEr5m9nXtPLlPzvebVSHbHSOh7rxVjCH0baQMRlX5TWLQMH74pmnuIFRiZVIfwffa6cL32t5sVE5Y/w640-h360/bitcoin-3089728.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">There is an ominous growth in Bitcoin ATMs across the United States, and some experts have claimed they are also one of the biggest cybercrime threats to the country.&nbsp;As with other ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs share a few characteristics with their cash counterparts: there are PINs to punch, and there are withdrawal fees as well.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, unlike cash ATMs, crypto ATMs have a high value, making them prime targets for hackers who are looking for ways to steal data.

The problem is that whereas the location of a cash ATM at a gas station may not draw much attention, the location of a Bitcoin ATM gets more scrutiny from fraudulent individuals. 

The UK's National Crime Agency has reported in an article published by CNBC on September 8 that Bitcoin ATMs have proven to be one of the most popular ways for individuals to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, although they have additionally evolved into a prime target for hackers and scammers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is no difference in the operation of these machines from traditional ATMs; however, thanks to the significant value of cryptocurrencies, they can be very attractive to cybercriminals, who will exploit both physical and digital vulnerabilities to their advantage.

According to Timothy Bates, an assistant professor of cybersecurity at the University of Michigan, these machines are especially vulnerable to hacking due to the lack of security measures that are often part of the software used in these devices.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Bates, Bitcoin ATMs can be infected by malware, which allows hackers to steal private keys and manipulate transactions through the use of malware. As well as this, an ATM can be compromised as a result of weaknesses in the security of the network, which may allow criminals to intercept communications between the ATM and its server, potentially allowing data theft to take place.



As a result of malware installed by hackers on Bitcoin ATMs, they can be compromised, steal private keys, or manipulate transactions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is especially concerning for ATMs that may not receive regular updates or security patches to prevent hackers from stealing funds or capturing private keys. A weakness in the network is also a weakness in the network security system.



A compromised machine's network communications can be intercepted by attackers if the ATM's network communications are not adequately secured. Consequently, stolen data can be accessed or the server could be accessed by unauthorized persons, Bates explained.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Bitcoin ATMs need to be taken seriously because of the threat posed by both hackers and scammers. Since 2020, according to a report released by the Federal Trade Commission this week, the number of scamming incidents has increased by 1,000%.

In a curious twist, the risks associated with Bitcoin ATMs are directly proportional to their strengths, according to Joe Dobson, the principal analyst at Mandiant, which is owned by Google Cloud and a company that specializes in cybersecurity.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There are three main characteristics of Bitcoin: decentralization, permissionlessness, and immutability.&nbsp;There is no way to reverse or reverse a transaction if funds are deposited to the wrong address, according to Dobson. Although many crypto bulls are attracted to Bitcoin because of its decentralization and lack of governance, it is a problem when used in ATMs. There are no regulations in the Bitcoin community that dictate who can run a Bitcoin ATM and who cannot, so independent organizations operate Bitcoin ATMs without any interference from the Bitcoin community," said Dobson.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this, some old criminal tricks might be reversible in a traditional banking system, but not so in the Bitcoin world, which comes with its own set of unique challenges. It is possible for someone, for instance, to maliciously place their deposit slips into the bank stack, which can lead to folks being tricked into depositing money into their accounts unknowingly.

According to Dobson, "there is the possibility that Bitcoin ATMs could also be subject to a similar attack."&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Dobson, "If an attacker compromises an ATM, they will be able to change the recipient wallet address (or "account number"), which in turn will steal the money of the user."&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitcoin ATMs, however, continue to spread old tricks as well and they also introduce newer threats that are not encountered by cash ATMs. Several Bitcoin ATMs require that users provide personally identifiable information, such as their ID number or even their Social Security number to satisfy "Know Your Customer (KYC)" requirements that are necessary in the financial industry.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Depending on the level of security that exists on a Bitcoin ATM, this information could be at risk.

The Middletown Food Mart, located on the fringes of the town, in a hollowed-out section of the town near the town's main road, has a Bitcoin Depot ATM running alongside a regular cash machine, which blends in with the potato chips, bottled water, and beer on sale.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Those who live in Middletown know that it is the hometown of Donald Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, who, similar to Trump, has refashioned himself as a crypto-advocate and has been speaking out against the adoption of Bitcoin. It is just a few blocks away from the Middletown Food Mart where Vance grew up where he works.

Among the best ways to avoid these scams is to be cautious and sceptical about any requests from users who want to make payments through a Bitcoin ATM. It is rare that legitimate businesses if they exist, will request payment in Bitcoin via a machine for their services.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During a transaction, users must verify the validity of the transaction, particularly checking the recipient's wallet for references to questionable entities," Frei said, adding that an additional precaution can be taken by using licensed ATMs from reliable operators.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Users will be able to follow certain steps to make sure they are dealing with a Bitcoin ATM or party that is legitimate and owned by someone reputable.

Adding to Frei's warning, he stressed the importance of being cautious and not sending bitcoins to unknown wallets. A platform like Chainabuse can help validate the legitimacy of the transaction by examining the risk score of the recipient's wallet, which can help verify their legitimacy.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the U.S., Bitcoin Depot operates over 8,000 ATMs, making it the country's largest operator of Bitcoin ATMs. Its chief executive, Brandon Mintz, assured CNBC that the company's software and hardware are designed to deter hackers, although he cautioned consumers not to fall victim to scams or be deceived by them. There seem to be just 10 operators worldwide who manage about 74% of ATMs in the world, as per Frei's analysis of data.</div>

<title>How I got started: AI security executive</title>
<link>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/how-i-got-started-ai-security-executive/</link>
<guid>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/how-i-got-started-ai-security-executive/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming increasingly crucial to cybersecurity systems. Organizations need professionals with a strong background that mixes AI/ML knowledge with cybersecurity skills, bringing on board people like Nicole Carignan, Vice President of Strategic Cyber AI at Darktrace, who has a unique blend of technical and soft skills. Carignan was originally a dance major but was also working for NASA as a hardware IT engineer, which forged her path into AI and cybersecurity.</p>
<h2>Where did you go to college?</h2>
<p>Carignan: I went to Texas A&amp;M University. I got a computer science degree, and the specialized track that I followed was in mathematics, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a>, computer/human interaction and assembly. My thesis was on setting up a maps application using graph theory in order to facilitate the best navigation &mdash; stuff that&rsquo;s common nowadays with applications like Google Maps. But that was the type of AI applications we had back then, and it is cool to see how it&rsquo;s evolved over time.</p>
<h2>What was your first job in IT?</h2>
<p>Carignan: I originally had a dance scholarship, but I was already working for NASA, supporting systems in mission control. They said, we will keep you employed throughout college and after if you get a computer science or engineering degree, so that&rsquo;s how I got into the field. I started off in the federal IT space.</p>
<h2>What made you decide to pursue cybersecurity?</h2>
<p>Carignan: I got recruited into the intelligence community. Even though that was an IT role, it had a heavy emphasis on security. This was in 2000, so <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a> wasn&rsquo;t really an industry yet. A few years later, I was on an overseas trip for work and I got hacked. That was actually what piqued my interest in cybersecurity, and I took a pretty big detour from my original plans.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://skillsbuild.org/college-educators/learning-pathways/security" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Explore cybersecurity learning paths</a>
<h2>What facilitated your move to AI?</h2>
<p>Carignan: I always enjoyed the data analytics component of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">machine learning</a> and AI. A decade into my career in the intelligence community, I joined a big data company that had large volumes of network telemetry and access to 300 different cyber <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/threat-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">threat intelligence</a> feeds. Around that time, the typical journey of a security company was the transition into experimentation of supervised machine learning classifiers, and we started with classifying content of endpoints and communication language, moving into classification of patterns of reported attacks.</p>
<h2>What is your job today?</h2>
<p>Carignan: So I had the cross-section of data science, machine learning and security in my job experience, and the opportunity at Darktrace seemed like a perfect fit. They weren&rsquo;t tackling the security problem with big data machine learning like a lot of other organizations, but rather they were looking at a much more customized, targeted, specific area by building out unsupervised machine learning and algorithms to understand every asset&rsquo;s pattern of life within the environment. We do have the use of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">generative AI</a> and LLMs, but we use that for semantic analysis and understanding changes in communications between email partners. Overall, what I saw Darktrace doing with very different machine learning techniques, I was intrigued to come on board.</p>
<h2>What are some of the soft skills that helped you in your security and AI career?</h2>
<p>Carignan: So, I&rsquo;m a theater kid and a dance major. I think those skills really prepared me for the level of communication and collaboration that is needed to tackle some of the more complex problems that we face across the industry.</p>
<h2>Any words of wisdom you&rsquo;d like to share with people who are considering a career in AI and cybersecurity?</h2>
<p>Carignan: I think it is really important to have a diversity of thought within your team. I&rsquo;m a big advocate of neurodiversity. What drew me to Darktrace was how much they had achieved in equity for gender, and that they are trying to achieve with other minority groups. Cybersecurity isn&rsquo;t a silo industry anymore, not with cloud, SaaS applications, AI. <span class="resolved">We need to approach enveloping these technologies into security across industries, and we can&rsquo;t do that without diversity of thought.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

Yet, the surveillance industry has not been fixed. On the contrary, the spyware problem seems to worsen as time passes.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In light of these issues, civil society organizations and business organizations have written an open letter on Tuesday, September 3 encouraging European regulators to take more decisive action to combat the threats posed by the overuse of spyware to fight the dangers it brings.



In the opinion of the experts, it is a non-negotiable issue - the EU Commission needs to come up with a legal framework that includes "a ban on the manufacturing, exporting, selling, importing, acquiring, transferring, servicing, and using of spyware inside the EU."&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is a loose definition of spyware in computer science, but it is generally considered to be malicious software that enters a user's computer, gathers data about them, and relays that data to a third party without their knowledge or consent.



Additionally, there are legitimate software programs, such as consumer monitoring software, that collect and use information from user's computers to provide users with advertisements that are relevant to them&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is however worth noting that malicious spyware is specifically designed to take advantage of the theft of personal information to make money.

There is no doubt that spyware can gather and collect private data, which leaves them open to data breaches and the misuse of their personal information, regardless of whether the person using their information is legitimate or not. 



The result of spyware campaigns is that devices and networks are slower, delaying daily user activities and resulting in increased costs.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Understanding the way spyware works is an important part of preventing issues when using it in both business and personal settings.



A crucial aspect of spyware which makes it so dangerous is the fact that it can be very difficult to detect, yet pretty easy to inject. This fact makes it one of the key strengths of spyware.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is an excellent example of a zero-click attack, called Pegasus since users can harvest it without leaving a trace on any device that becomes infected. There is no security software, not even the best VPN or antivirus apps, that can fully protect users against this growing threat, which makes it impossible for their use alone to be helpful.

In the future, it would be reasonable to argue that spyware may one day be one of the most crucial tools available to governments for the purpose of national security.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As of yet, however, there has been a longer list of authorities that have abused the accessibility of the service.





A report claims that Mexico became the first organization to purchase the Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group's powerful technology in 2011 to support the country's fight against narco-trafficking to help the country combat the drug problem. According to the investigative team of Pegasus, more than a dozen Mexican journalists and activists had their phones found to be infected with the virus in 2017.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is believed that over 50,000 phones all over the world were compromised during the Pandora's box incident in 2021. The phone that belonged to the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in 2018, is one of the ones included in these records. In the course of the investigation, it was revealed that over 46 countries around the world bought this very intrusive tool, including at least 14 different nations in the European Union.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In a new investigation into the use of so-called Predator spyware a few years later, a more in-depth analysis showed that the EU spyware problem is worse than originally thought. It is most likely because the tool was not just used across the EU as a spying tool for journalists, politicians, and activists, but because it was developed, distributed, and exported by EU-based firms based in France, Ireland, and Greece, most of which operate in at least 25 countries around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Its hard to comprehend how the spy industry is still allowed to function as one of the most lucrative fields of business today. It seems that even Google is concerned that this outbreak of information warfare could pose a threat to free speech, free press, and the integrity of elections throughout the world.&nbsp;

As an example, many companies are turning to what is known as bossware to improve the monitoring of their remote workers in an effort to make sure they are on top of things.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div>Work productivity monitoring applications, though legal in many countries, raise significant concerns regarding the potential for abuse. These tools, originally designed to track employee performance, have also opened the door to misuse. While the specific regulations around such software vary depending on jurisdiction, the risk of unethical usage persists across the board.</div><div><br /></div><div>Particularly alarming is the potential for these applications to be weaponized by malicious actors, including hackers, stalkers, and even criminals. The accessibility of these technologies, which often do not require extensive technical knowledge to operate, leaves many individuals exposed to cyber threats. In more personal contexts, such as domestic abuse, an abusive partner could use such an app to exert control, spy on communications, or track movements, further exacerbating the dangers of spyware.</div><div><br /></div><div>This growing concern is reflected in recent statistics. A study by the security firm Avast reported a staggering 329% increase in mobile stalkerware usage since 2020. Such figures highlight the expanding threat posed by spyware, not only in corporate environments but also in everyday life.</div><div><br /></div><div>Further complicating matters is the blurred line between the use of spyware by governments and its regulation. The New York Times recently conducted an investigation revealing that, although the Biden administration has officially banned the use of hacking tools created by the Israeli firm NSO, there remain ongoing efforts by U.S. authorities to find a legal avenue for their utilization. This suggests that while some forms of spyware are deemed unacceptable for certain uses, governments may still be inclined to leverage them under particular circumstances, thereby setting a complex precedent for how these tools should be governed.</div><div><br /></div><div>The international community has begun addressing this issue. On February 6, 2024, the United Kingdom and France spearheaded an international agreement aimed at curbing the human rights abuses associated with spyware. This joint effort seeks to establish policies that regulate the deployment of intrusive cyber tools in a manner that is both legal and responsible. However, despite these efforts, skepticism remains about whether such regulations will be sufficient to prevent the harm caused by spyware.</div><div><br /></div><div>In 2022, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) raised significant concerns about the impact of modern spyware on individual privacy. The EDPS emphasized that the unprecedented level of intrusiveness offered by such technology "threatens the essence of the right to privacy" due to its ability to infiltrate the most intimate aspects of daily life. In their view, the use of spyware is fundamentally incompatible with European Union (EU) law, further underscoring the challenges of regulating this highly invasive technology.</div><div><br /></div><div>The most effective way to manage the threat of spyware is through prevention. However, avoiding spyware installation isn't always straightforward. Cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities in even trusted websites, allowing them to infect a user's computer without any interaction. In such scenarios, relying solely on avoiding suspicious downloads or attachments is insufficient protection.</div><div><br /></div><div>To safeguard against spyware, individuals are advised to use robust internet security solutions that include reliable antivirus and antimalware detection features. In addition to standard protection, these solutions should offer proactive defences, such as real-time monitoring and detection of potential threats. For users whose systems have already been compromised, many security providers offer specialized spyware removal utilities, designed to identify and eliminate spyware from infected devices. It is crucial, however, to ensure that these utilities are obtained from reputable security providers, as some fraudulent software tools masquerade as spyware removal programs while actually embedding spyware themselves.</div><div><br /></div><div>While several free antivirus options are available, it is important to recognize their limitations. A free trial can be useful for assessing a product's capabilities, but for comprehensive protection, especially against spyware, users should consider investing in a full-featured internet security suite. Features like virtual encrypted keyboards for securely entering financial information, strong anti-spam filters, and cloud-based detection systems can provide critical layers of defence, reducing the risks posed by spyware schemes.</div><div><br /></div><div>At end, while productivity monitoring apps and spyware can serve legitimate purposes, their potential for abuse, combined with their increasing use, underscores the need for stringent regulation, heightened awareness, and proactive security measures to protect against both corporate misuse and individual harm.</div></div>

But, as with any powerful tool, threat actors are trying to use it for malicious reasons. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03315" target="_blank">Researchers</a> suggest that the underground market for illicit large language models is enticing, highlighting a need for strong safety measures against AI misuse.&nbsp;<p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">These underground markets that deal with malicious large language models (LLMs) are called Mallas. This blog dives into the details of this dark industry and discusses the impact of these illicit LLMs on cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Rise of Malicious LLMs</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">LLMs, like OpenAI' GPT-4 have shown fine results in natural language processing, bringing applications like chatbots for content generation. However, the same tech that supports these useful apps can be misused for suspicious activities.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, researchers from Indian University Bloomington found 212 malicious LLMs on underground marketplaces between April and September last year. One of the models "WormGPT" made around $28,000 in just two months, revealing a trend among threat actors misusing AI and a rising demand for these harmful tools.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">How Uncensored Models Operate&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Various LLMs in the market were uncensored and built using open-source standards, few were jailbroken commercial models. Threat actors used Mallas to write phishing emails, build malware, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.01637v1" target="_blank">exploit&nbsp;</a>zero days.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tech giants working in the AI models industry have built measures to protect against jailbreaking and detecting malicious attempts. But threat actors have also found ways to jump the guardrails and trick AI models like Google Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic into providing malicious info.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Underground Market for LLMs</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Experts found two uncensored LLMs: DarkGPT, which costs 78 cents per 50 messages, and Escape GPT, a subscription model that charges $64.98 a month. Both models generate harmful code that antivirus tools fail to detect two-thirds of the time. Another model "WolfGPT" costs $150, and allows users to write phishing emails that can escape most spam detectors.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The research findings suggest all harmful AI models could make malware, and 41.5% could create phishing emails. These models were built upon OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, Claude Instant, Claude-2-100k, and Pygmalion 13B.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To fight these threats, experts have suggested a dataset of prompts used to make malware and escape safety features. AI companies should release models with default censorship settings and allow access to illicit models only for research purposes.</p>

Hackers are leveraging increasingly sophisticated techniques to trick users into clicking on ads that install malware or lead to phishing scams.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Jérôme Segura, senior director of research at Malwarebytes, warns that this surge is “just the tip of the iceberg,” as more companies and individuals fall victim to such attacks.

Many of these fraudulent ads appear as sponsored content during routine Google searches, posing as legitimate brands or services. Some only ensnare consumers who click on them, but others can exploit vulnerabilities, infecting users merely by visiting an infected site.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Even corporate employees are being targeted, as hackers prey on their trust in internal portals. For example, hackers recently created a fake Google ad impersonating Lowe’s, which misled employees into entering a phishing page disguised as the retailer’s employee portal.

While Google and other search engines like Bing are not responsible for these attacks, their widespread use and high level of consumer trust make them prime targets for cybercriminals.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Stuart Madnick, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, users often let their guard down, believing that anything appearing in a Google search is safe.

To mitigate the risk of malvertising, cybersecurity experts recommend users avoid clicking on sponsored links and double-check URLs before proceeding.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Keeping browsers up-to-date is crucial to avoid drive-by downloads, a method that installs malware simply by visiting a compromised website.

Chris Pierson, CEO of BlackCloak, urges consumers to be wary of phone numbers from ads, as scammers could hijack them.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">He advises verifying numbers directly from company websites or official documentation.

Installing anti-malware software and using privacy browsers or ad blockers can also protect consumers from malicious ads.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Reporting suspicious ads helps reduce the spread of malvertising, but Madnick reminds users to stay vigilant, adding, “You should assume that this could happen to you no matter how careful you are.”</div>

This finding could have far-reaching implications for the digital advertising ecosystem, affecting thousands of publishers and advertisers in the UK and potentially beyond.<p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The CMA’s Findings</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The CMA’s investigation has revealed that Google has been engaging in anti-competitive practices that stifle competition and innovation. According to the CMA, Google has been leveraging its market power to favor its own ad tech services over those of its competitors. This behavior includes restricting access to key data and tools that rivals need to compete effectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The CMA’s provisional findings suggest that Google’s practices have created significant barriers to entry and expansion for other companies in the ad tech market. This has led to reduced competition, which in turn has likely resulted in higher prices and less choice for consumers and businesses.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Google’s Response</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In response to the CMA’s findings, Google has stated that the conclusions are flawed and that they will respond accordingly. Google argues that its ad tech services benefit publishers and advertisers by providing them with efficient and effective tools to reach their audiences. The company also points out that the digital advertising market is highly dynamic and competitive, with numerous players offering a wide range of services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google’s defense highlights the complexity of the digital advertising ecosystem, where multiple factors influence market dynamics. However, the CMA remains concerned that Google’s practices are undermining competition and harming the interests of consumers and businesses.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Potential Consequences</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">If the CMA’s provisional findings are upheld, Google could face significant consequences. The CMA has the authority to impose financial penalties and legally binding directions to address anti-competitive behavior. This could include measures to ensure that Google provides fair access to its ad tech services and data, allowing rivals to compete on a level playing field.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Such actions could have a profound impact on the digital advertising landscape. By promoting greater competition, the CMA aims to foster innovation and improve outcomes for publishers, advertisers, and consumers. Increased competition could lead to lower prices, better services, and more choice in the market.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Broader Implications</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The CMA’s investigation into Google’s ad tech practices is part of a broader trend of regulatory scrutiny of major tech companies. Around the world, regulators are increasingly concerned about the market power of digital giants and their impact on competition and consumer welfare. In the European Union, the Digital Markets Act aims to address similar issues by imposing stricter rules on dominant digital platforms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the United States, the Department of Justice and several state attorneys general have launched antitrust lawsuits against Google, alleging anti-competitive practices in the search and advertising markets. These actions reflect a growing consensus among regulators that more needs to be done to ensure fair competition in the digital economy.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">What Is Next for Google?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">As the CMA considers Google’s representations, the outcome of this investigation will be closely watched by stakeholders across the digital advertising ecosystem. Publishers, advertisers, and tech companies will be keen to see how the CMA’s findings are addressed and what measures are put in place to promote competition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For Google, the stakes are high. The company must navigate a complex regulatory environment while continuing to innovate and provide value to its users. At the same time, it must address the concerns of regulators and demonstrate that its practices are fair and pro-competitive.</p>

Qilin, active since at least 2022, is already notorious for its "double extortion" strategy. This method involves encrypting the victim’s data while simultaneously threatening to leak or sell the data unless a ransom is paid.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The discovery of Qilin's latest tactic underscores the evolution of ransomware attacks into more sophisticated and damaging operations.

The breach came to light following an attack on Synnovis, a UK governmental healthcare service provider.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The attack began with the exploitation of compromised credentials to access the organization’s VPN portal, which lacked multi-factor authentication (MFA), allowing the attackers initial access. Once inside, the attackers spent 18 days conducting surveillance before moving laterally to a domain controller.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Here, they modified the Group Policy Objects (GPO) to implement a malicious PowerShell script named `IPScanner.ps1`. This script was designed to harvest login credentials stored in Google Chrome browsers and was automatically executed every time users logged into their devices.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The stolen credentials were stored in the SYSVOL share, labeled by the infected device's hostname, and subsequently exfiltrated to the attackers' command-and-control server. To avoid detection, the attackers cleared event logs and deleted the local data copies before deploying the ransomware.

Given that Google Chrome holds over 65 per cent of the browser market share, the attackers were able to access a large array of usernames and passwords stored by users, raising the scale of the breach.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This method of credential harvesting introduces a new layer of threat, potentially allowing Qilin to access multiple high-value targets, complicating response efforts for organizations.

Affected organizations have been urged to reset all Active Directory passwords and advise users to change the passwords of any sites saved in Chrome.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This tactic may serve as a "bonus multiplier" for attackers, increasing the chaos inherent in ransomware situations by gaining insights into high-value accounts, making future attacks even more damaging.

This breach highlights a growing concern over organizations' abilities to defend against such multifaceted and evolving ransomware threats</div>

An investigation by Microsoft has revealed that a North Korean threat actor exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Chromium browser that has been tracked as CVE-2024-7971 to conduct a sophisticated cyber operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to the report, Citrine Sleet, the notorious group behind the attack that targets cryptography sectors in particular, is responsible for the attack.

It has been reported that CVE-2024-7971 is a type of confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that had been impacted in versions of Chrome before 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, threat actors could gain remote code execution (RCE) access to the sandboxed Chromium renderer process and conduct a remote attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There was a vulnerability that was fixed by Google on August 21, 2024, and users should ensure that they are running the most recent version of Chrome.

It is clear from this development that the nation-state adversary is trying to increase its penetration of Windows zero-day exploits in recent months, indicating that they are persistent in their efforts to acquire and introduce oodles of zero-day exploits.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Microsoft security researcher found evidence that Citrine Sleet (formerly DEV-0139 and DEV-1222) was responsible for the activity. Citrine Sleet is also known as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, Nickel Academy, and UNC4736, all of which are associated with Citrine Sleet. There is an assessment that this sub-cluster is part of the Lazarus Group (a.k.a. Diamond Sleet and Hidden Cobra) which is related to Lazarus.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Several analysts have previously credited the use of AppleJeus malware to a Lazarus subgroup called BlueNoroff (also known as APT38, Nickel Gladstone, and Stardust Chollima), indicating the fact that the threat actors share both toolsets and infrastructure from one subgroup to another.

Some cybersecurity vendors maintain track of this North Korean threat group under different names, such as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, and UNC4736, among others.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Hidden Cobra is a term used by the U.S. government to describe malicious actors sponsored by the North Korean government collectively as being influenced by the state. It is mostly targeted at financial institutions, with a special focus on cryptocurrency organizations and individuals who are closely associated with the cryptocurrency industry.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the past, it has been linked to Bureau 121 of the Reconnaissance General Bureau of North Korea, where it practices intelligence gathering.

Moreover, North Korean hackers are also known for using malicious websites that appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to infect prospective victims with fake job applications, weaponized cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading apps designed to steal sensitive information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is the first time UNC4736 malware has been identified in a supply chain attack, for example in March 2023 it attacked the Electron-based desktop client of video conferencing software provider 3CX. Further, they were able to breach the website of Trading Technologies, an automation company for stock market trading, to sneakily push trojanized versions of the X_TRADER software into the system.

In a March 2022 report, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) also linked AppleJeus to the compromise of Trading Technologies' website, highlighting AppleJeus as being behind the attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For years, the U.S. government has repeatedly issued warnings about state-sponsored cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency-related businesses and individuals with AppleJeus malware that is backed by the North Korean government. As a result of the security vulnerability CVE-2024-7971 that was discovered last week, Google patched Chrome's version 8 JavaScript engine and reported it as a type confusion vulnerability.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In a recent cybersecurity incident report, it was revealed that victims were directed to a domain controlled by the threat group Citrine Sleet, identified as voyagorclub[.]space. The exact method by which victims were lured to this domain remains undetermined, though it is suspected that social engineering tactics were employed. This is consistent with Citrine Sleet’s established modus operandi, which frequently involves manipulating individuals through social engineering to initiate attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon successful redirection to the malicious domain, attackers leveraged a zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-7971. This vulnerability is linked to a type of confusion flaw in Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Google addressed this security issue in a recent patch, highlighting that it allowed attackers to achieve RCE within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process of the victim's browser. Once inside this sandboxed environment, the attackers further escalated their access by exploiting a secondary vulnerability in the Windows kernel.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The additional vulnerability, CVE-2024-38106, was exploited to escape the browser’s sandbox environment. This kernel vulnerability, which Microsoft had patched in their latest Patch Tuesday release, allowed attackers to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the compromised system. Following this, the attackers downloaded and activated a highly sophisticated rootkit known as FudModule. This malware, when loaded into memory, enabled direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM), providing attackers with the capability to bypass critical kernel security measures.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The FudModule rootkit is particularly concerning, as it is designed to manipulate kernel-level processes, enabling attackers to establish persistent backdoor access to the compromised system. Through DKOM, the rootkit effectively tampers with core system functions, allowing attackers to evade detection, steal sensitive information, and potentially deploy additional malicious software.

Interestingly, the FudModule rootkit has been linked to another North Korean state-sponsored group known as Diamond Sleet, which has utilized this malware since its discovery in October 2022.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This suggests a potential collaboration between Citrine Sleet and Diamond Sleet or, at the very least, shared access to malicious tools and infrastructure. Furthermore, the rootkit bears similarities to tools used by another notorious hacking group, the Lazarus Group, indicating that FudModule may be part of a broader North Korean cyber-espionage toolkit.

Citrine Sleet's attack demonstrates a highly coordinated and multi-faceted approach, beginning with social engineering techniques to lure victims to a compromised domain and culminating in the exploitation of critical vulnerabilities to gain deep control over target systems.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By leveraging both CVE-2024-7971 and CVE-2024-38106, the attackers were able to bypass multiple layers of security, from browser sandboxing to Windows kernel defences.

Microsoft has issued a series of recommendations to help organizations mitigate the risk of such attacks. They stress the importance of maintaining up-to-date software and operating systems, as timely patching is critical to closing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Microsoft advocates for the deployment of security solutions that provide unified visibility across the entire cyberattack chain. Such tools can detect and block attacker tools and post-compromise malicious activity. Lastly, strengthening the configuration of the operating environment is recommended to minimize the likelihood of successful exploitation and post-compromise activity. 

This incident underscores the evolving nature of cyber threats and highlights the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures to detect, block, and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs).</div>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Citrine Sleet threat actor group was observed by Microsoft researchers exploiting the CVE-2024-7971 zero-day vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which affects versions of Chromium prior to 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attackers achieved remote code execution (RCE) within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process. Google has since released a patch for the vulnerability, on August 21, 2024, and users are advised to update to the latest version of Chromium to mitigate the risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;Technical Analysis&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The observed attack chain involved a typical browser exploit sequence, starting with targets being directed to a Citrine Sleet-controlled exploit domain, voyagorclub[.]space, through common social engineering tactics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the users were connected, the zero-day RCE exploit for CVE-2024-7971 was deployed, allowing the attackers to download and load shellcode containing a Windows sandbox escape exploit and the FudModule rootkit into memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>FudModule is an advanced rootkit <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">malware</a> designed to target kernel access while avoiding detection. Threat actors have been seen using the FudModule data-only rootkit to gain admin-to-kernel access on Windows-based systems, enabling read/write primitive operations and conducting Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attack chain seen in Citrine Sleet's zero-day exploit of CVE-2024-7971 closely mirrors the chain observed by Avast, which involves a variant of FudModule known as "FudModule 2.0." This variant includes malicious loaders and a late-stage remote access trojan (RAT). The research identified the previously unknown Kaolin RAT as the malware responsible for deploying the FudModule rootkit on targeted devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion and Recommendations&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>CVE-2024-7971 is the third vulnerability this year that North Korean threat actors have exploited to deploy the FudModule rootkit, following CVE-2024-21338 and CVE-2024-38193. To address zero-day exploits effectively, it is crucial not only to keep systems updated but also to use security solutions that offer comprehensive visibility across the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cyberattack</a> chain to detect and block attacker tools and malicious activities after exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Takeaways&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>A North Korean threat actor, Citrine Sleet, has been observed exploiting a <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/zero-day-exploit/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">zero-day vulnerability</a> in Chromium, designated as CVE-2024-7971, to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Citrine Sleet, also tracked by other security firms under the names AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, UNC4736, and Hidden Cobra, is attributed to Bureau 121 of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau. The group primarily focuses on financial institutions, especially those involved with cryptocurrency, aiming for financial gain. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) have now been linked to the FudModule rootkit, which has also been associated with Diamond Sleet, another North Korean threat actor. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Citrine Sleet creates fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to distribute fake job applications or entice targets into downloading a compromised cryptocurrency wallet or trading application. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The TA typically infects targets with its custom trojan malware, AppleJeus, designed to gather information necessary to take control of victims' cryptocurrency assets. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Citrine Sleet threat actor group was observed by Microsoft researchers exploiting the CVE-2024-7971 zero-day vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which affects versions of Chromium prior to 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attackers achieved remote code execution (RCE) within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process. Google has since released a patch for the vulnerability, on August 21, 2024, and users are advised to update to the latest version of Chromium to mitigate the risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;Technical Analysis&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The observed attack chain involved a typical browser exploit sequence, starting with targets being directed to a Citrine Sleet-controlled exploit domain, voyagorclub[.]space, through common social engineering tactics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the users were connected, the zero-day RCE exploit for CVE-2024-7971 was deployed, allowing the attackers to download and load shellcode containing a Windows sandbox escape exploit and the FudModule rootkit into memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>FudModule is an advanced rootkit <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">malware</a> designed to target kernel access while avoiding detection. Threat actors have been seen using the FudModule data-only rootkit to gain admin-to-kernel access on Windows-based systems, enabling read/write primitive operations and conducting Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attack chain seen in Citrine Sleet's zero-day exploit of CVE-2024-7971 closely mirrors the chain observed by Avast, which involves a variant of FudModule known as "FudModule 2.0." This variant includes malicious loaders and a late-stage remote access trojan (RAT). The research identified the previously unknown Kaolin RAT as the malware responsible for deploying the FudModule rootkit on targeted devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion and Recommendations&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>CVE-2024-7971 is the third vulnerability this year that North Korean threat actors have exploited to deploy the FudModule rootkit, following CVE-2024-21338 and CVE-2024-38193. To address zero-day exploits effectively, it is crucial not only to keep systems updated but also to use security solutions that offer comprehensive visibility across the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cyberattack</a> chain to detect and block attacker tools and malicious activities after exploitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To mitigate the risks posed by Citrine Sleet and similar threats, the following best practices are recommended:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Activate the automatic software update function on your computer, mobile device, and any other linked devices when feasible and practical. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Employ a trusted antivirus solution and internet security software suite on all connected devices, such as your PC, laptop, and mobile phone. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Conduct consistent vulnerability assessments to maintain proactive security. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Always use <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-is-a-part-of-your-cyber-hygiene/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">multi-factor authentication</a> on accounts to lessen the risk of takeover. </li>

<title>Sextortion Scams Now Include Photos of Your Home</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/sextortion-scams-now-include-photos-of-your-home/</link>
<guid>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/sextortion-scams-now-include-photos-of-your-home/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An old but persistent email scam known as &#8220;<strong>sextortion</strong>&#8221; has a new personalized touch: The missives, which claim that malware has captured webcam footage of recipients pleasuring themselves, now include a photo of the target&#8217;s home in a bid to make threats about publishing the videos more frightening and convincing.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-44412" height="134" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sextortion.png" width="750" /></p>
<p>This week, several readers reported receiving sextortion emails that addressed them by name and included images of their street or front yard that were apparently lifted from an online mapping application such as <strong>Google Maps</strong>.</p>
<p>The message purports to have been sent from a hacker who’s compromised your computer and used your webcam to record a video of you while you were watching porn. The missive threatens to release the video to all of your contacts unless you pay a Bitcoin ransom. In this case, the demand is just shy of $2,000, payable by scanning a QR code embedded in the email.</p>
<p>Following a salutation that includes the recipient&#8217;s full name, the start of the message reads, &#8220;Is visiting [recipient&#8217;s street address] a more convenient way to contact if you don&#8217;t take action. Nice location btw.&#8221; Below that is the photo of the recipient&#8217;s street address.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_68587" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-68587" height="677" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sextortion-maps.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-68587">A semi-redacted screenshot of a newish sextortion scam that includes a photo of the target&#8217;s front yard.</p></div>
<p>The message tells people they have 24 hours to pay up, or else their embarrassing videos will be released to all of their contacts, friends and family members.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t even think about replying to this, it&#8217;s pointless,&#8221; the message concludes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t make mistakes, [recipient&#8217;s name]. If I notice that you&#8217;ve shared or discussed this email with someone else, your shitty video will instantly start getting sent to your contacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remaining sections of the two-page sextortion message (which arrives as a PDF attachment) are fairly formulaic and include thematic elements seen in most previous sextortion waves. Those include claims that the extortionist has installed malware on your computer (in this case the scammer claims the spyware is called &#8220;Pegasus,&#8221; and that they are watching everything you do on your machine).</p>
<p>Previous innovations in sextortion customization involved sending emails that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">included at least one password they had previously used</a> at an account online that was tied to their email address. <span id="more-68585"></span></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>Sextortion — even semi-automated scams like this one with no actual physical leverage to backstop the extortion demand — is a serious crime that can lead to devastating consequences for victims. Sextortion occurs when someone threatens to distribute your private and sensitive material if you don’t provide them with images of a sexual nature, sexual favors, or money.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, here are some things you can do to avoid becoming a victim:</p>
<p>-Never send compromising images of yourself to anyone, no matter who they are — or who they say they are.<br />
-Don’t open attachments from people you don’t know, and be wary of opening attachments even from those you do know.<br />
-Turn off [and/or cover] any web cameras when you are not using them.</p>
<p>The FBI says in many sextortion cases, the perpetrator is an adult pretending to be a teenager, and you are just one of the many victims being targeted by the same person. If you believe you’re a victim of sextortion, or know someone else who is, the FBI wants to hear from you: Contact your local FBI office (or toll-free at 1-800-CALL-FBI).</p>

<guid>https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-google-chrome-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution_2024-094</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

By using phishing tactics, hackers are targeting users' passwords for Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon through phishing campaigns that pose significant risks to their personal information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A new notice has appeared warning users of Google Mail, Facebook, and Amazon that there has been a new attack on password hacking that puts their personal information at risk because society has gone digital and protecting your credentials is "the name of the game." 

There is no denying the fact that these platforms are among the most popular in the world, so it is vital to have a good understanding of what threats are coming and what possibilities there are to prevent these threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Overall, cybersecurity experts predict a steady increase for the year, but they also note that the complexity of password hacks for Gmail and Facebook, as well as attempts to access Amazon accounts, has grown dramatically as well. It has been found that the complexity of password hacks for Gmail and Facebook has increased dramatically as a result of increased complexity in the attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Typically, these hacking attempts benefit from phishing attacks, brute force attacks, and social engineering attacks, all of which are designed to take advantage of overly trustful users or weaknesses within the platforms that make them vulnerable.

Several new threat analyses, including those conducted by Kaspersky Labs, reveal that password theft attacks have become increasingly common against Amazon users, Facebook users, and, most of all, Google users. 

There have been several attacks targeting these platforms, including those aimed at stealing passwords.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Kaspersky reported an increase of 40% in attempts of hackers to entice users to access malicious sites impersonating these brands in comparison to last year based on a study it conducted.

It is no surprise that malicious hackers are seeking credentials for Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon accounts to spread their malicious programming. As a matter of fact, these accounts may be exploited to reach the full heights of cybercrime by committing data theft, malware distribution, and credit card fraud all at the same time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Google account is a skeleton key that can be used to unlock an entire treasure trove of other account credentials, as well as personal information, enabling fraudsters to access a treasure trove of private information. The information contained in a user's Gmail inbox is immeasurable when compared to that contained in their inbox on the web, and the chances are that they will have one given how popular this web-based free email service is with most people these days. 

As per Kaspersky reports, hackers are mainly targeting Google, Amazon, and Facebook passwords in their effort to steal personal information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the first half of 2024, Kaspersky Security reported a 243% increase in the number of attack attempts, with the company itself preventing approximately 4 million attempts. It is estimated that Facebook users were exposed to 3.7 million phishing attempts during the same period, and Amazon users were exposed to 3 million.&nbsp;

In an interview with Kaspersky Internet Security, Olga Svistunova, who is an expert in data security at the company, warned that a criminal with access to a Gmail account may be able to access "multiple services".&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, it is important to note that not only may business information be leaked as a result, but also the personal information of customers can also be leaked as a result.

To target these platforms, hackers are looking for account passwords, as getting access to these platforms allows them to commit fraud, distribute malware, and steal sensitive information. It is proposed that Google accounts are especially valuable since they can be used to hack into other accounts and to collect personal information that can be used in fraud attempts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to researchers at GuidePoint Research and Intelligence Team, Rui Ataide and Hermes Bojaxhi of the GuidePoint Research and Intelligence Team, there is an ongoing phishing campaign targeting more than 130 U.S. organizations, which has been detected as a new and worrying one. There have been so many misuses of the term "highly sophisticated threat actor" in recent years that it almost has lost all meaning, but the tactics and intrusion capabilities that were employed by this as-yet-unnamed attacker have led the GRIT researchers to conclude that this attacker deserves to be called such a label.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A spear-phishing attack, as with other spear-phishing campaigns, revolves around the targeting of specific employees within an organization rather than attempting to hit every single email account in an organization with a scattergun approach, as is so often the case with so-called spear-phishing campaigns.

The attack has also targeted other tech giants, including Microsoft and Apple, as well as numerous smaller companies. Additionally, DHL, Mastercard, Netflix, eBay, and HSBC are also among the companies involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cloud security provider Netskope, in a recent report, found a 2,000-fold increase in traffic to phishing pages sent through Microsoft Sway, a cloud-based application that provides users with the ability to create visual instructions, newsletters, and presentations through the use of visual illustrations.

Hackers are increasingly exploiting a technique known as “quishing,” a form of phishing that utilizes QR codes to deceive users into logging into malicious websites, thereby stealing their passwords. This method is particularly effective as QR codes can bypass email scanners designed to detect text-based threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, since QR codes are frequently scanned with mobile devices—which often lack the robust security measures found on desktops and laptops—users become more vulnerable to these types of attacks.

A new variant of QR code phishing has been recently detailed by J. Stephen Kowski, the Field Chief Technology Officer at SlashNext, in a LinkedIn article. Unlike traditional QR code phishing, which typically involves an image-based QR code redirecting users to a malicious site, this new method leverages Unicode text characters to create QR codes.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Kowski, this approach presents three significant challenges for defenders: it evades image-based analysis, ensures accurate screen rendering, and creates a duality in appearance between the screen rendering and plain text, making detection more difficult.

Given these emerging threats, individuals who frequently use platforms such as Google’s Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon, as well as other major online services, should exercise caution to avoid becoming victims of identity theft. The risk of falling prey to password-hacking attempts can be significantly reduced by adhering to best practices in security hygiene across different accounts and maintaining a high level of vigilance.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In today’s technology-driven world, personal awareness and proactive measures serve as the first line of defence against such cyber threats.



Protecting Business Accounts from Phishing Attacks&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Recognize Phishing Indicators</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">- Generic Domain Extensions: Be cautious of emails from generic domains like "@gmail.com" instead of corporate domains, as attackers use these to impersonate businesses.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Misspelt Domains: </b>Watch for near-identical domains that slightly alter legitimate ones, such as "Faceb0ok.com." These deceptive domains are used to trick users into providing sensitive information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Content Quality:</b> Legitimate communications are typically polished and professional. Spelling errors, poor grammar, and unprofessional formatting are red flags of phishing attempts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Urgency and Fear Tactics:</b> Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency, pressuring recipients to act quickly to avoid negative consequences, such as account suspensions or security breaches.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Unusual Requests:</b> Be wary of unexpected requests for money, personal information, or prompts to click links or download attachments. Hackers often impersonate trusted entities to deceive recipients.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Implement Security Software&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">-<b> Install robust security tools,</b> including firewalls, spam filters, and antivirus software, to guard against phishing attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">- <b>Utilize web filters</b> to restrict access to malicious websites.

   - Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities and protect against new threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Enhance account security</b> by implementing MFA, which requires a second verification factor (e.g., a code, fingerprint, or secret question) in addition to a password.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- MFA significantly</b> reduces the risk of unauthorized access and helps safeguard business credentials.

By staying vigilant, maintaining updated security software, and utilizing MFA, businesses can better protect their accounts and sensitive information from phishing attacks.</div>

Cybercriminals are believed to have named the malware "Voldemort" based on the internal file names and strings used in it.&nbsp;

As part of the attack chain, multiple tactics have been employed, some of which are currently popular in the threat landscape, while others are less common, such as using Google Sheets as a program for command and control (C2).&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is noteworthy that in addition to tactical, technical, and procedural (TTPs) components, it takes advantage of a lure theme impersonating the government agencies of a variety of countries, and it uses odd file naming and passwords such as "test". Several researchers initially suspected that the activity may be a red team, but analysis of the malware and the number of messages indicated that it was a threat actor very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There has been an aggressive malware campaign known as "Voldemort" launched against organizations all over the world, impersonating tax authorities in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. Since the malicious activity was launched on Aug. 5, more than 20,000 phishing messages were reported worldwide by dozens of companies. According to Proofpoint, over 20,000 phishing messages were reported during the last three months.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A custom backdoor has been written in C and was designed to enable data exfiltration and the deployment of additional malicious payloads, as well as the exfiltration of data itself. 

The exploit is based on an exploit that takes advantage of a browser extension called 'Google Sheets' to be used as the C2 communication tool for the attack, and files that are infected with a malicious Windows search protocol are used to carry out the attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As soon as the victim downloads the malware, it uses WebEx software to load a DLL that communicates with the C2 server using a legitimate version of WebEx software.

There are several attack chains outlined in this attack chain, which include a variety of techniques currently common in the threat landscape, as well as a variety of rarely used methods of command and control (C2) such as the use of Google Sheets.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) have been applied to it in combination with lure themes impersonating government agencies of various countries as well as its strange file naming and passwords, such as "test". Initial suspicions were that this activity might have been the work of a red team, but the large volume of messages and an analysis of the malware indicated that it was the work of a threat actor very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Proofpoint's assessment, there is a moderate amount of confidence that this is likely the actions of an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor that is seeking to gather intelligence. Although Proofpoint is well-versed in identifying named threat actors, it is still not confident enough with the data available to attribute a specific TA with high certainty. There is no doubt that some aspects of the malware, such as the widespread targeting and characteristics, are associated more often with cybercrime activity, but the nature of the malware does not appear to be motivated by financial gain at this time, but more by espionage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Powered by C, Voldemort is a custom backdoor that was written to gather information. As well as the capability to gather information, it also can drop additional payloads on the target. As Proofpoint discovered, Cobalt Strike was being hosted on the actor's infrastructure, and that would likely be one of the payloads that is being delivered by the actor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

There was a significant increase in phishing emails sent daily by the hackers beginning on August 17, when nearly 6,000 emails appeared to be impersonating tax agencies, which was high, according to the researchers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, the HM Revenue &amp; Customs in the United Kingdom, and the Direction Générale des Finances Publiques in France joined the list of potential regulators. A layer of credibility was added to the lures by crafting the phishing email in the native language of the respective tax authority, adding a high degree of legitimacy to the message.

As part of their authenticity, the emails received from what appeared to be compromised domains contained the legitimate domain names of the tax agencies, to make them appear more genuine.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is no definitive answer to the overall objective of the campaign, though Proofpoint researchers say it seems likely that the campaign is aimed at espionage, given Voldemort's intelligence-gathering capacities as well as his ability to deploy additional payloads into the mainstream.



There are more than half of all targeted organizations fall into the sectors of insurance, aerospace, transportation, and education.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The threat actor behind this campaign is unknown, but Proofpoint believes that it may be engaged in cyber espionage operations as a means of obtaining information.



Likewise, the messages also contain Google AMP Cache URLs that redirect to the landing page on InfinityFree, as well as a direct link to the landing page, which is included in the campaign later on. Towards the bottom of the landing page, there is a button that says "Click to view the document", which when clicked, checks the User Agent or software in the browser.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When the User Agent contains "Windows," the browser is automatically redirected to a search-ms URI, which points to a TryCloudflare-tunneled URI ending in .search-ms. This redirection prompts the victim to open Windows Explorer, although the specific query responsible for this action remains hidden from the victim, leaving only a popup visible. Concurrently, an image is loaded from a URL ending in /stage1 on an IP address that is managed by the logging service pingb.in. This service enables the threat actor to record a successful redirect and collect additional browser and network information about the victim.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A distinguishing feature of the Voldemort malware is its use of Google Sheets as a command and control (C2) server. The malware pings Google Sheets to retrieve new commands to execute on the compromised device and to serve as a repository for exfiltrated data. Each infected machine writes its data to specific cells within the Google Sheet, which are often designated by unique identifiers, such as UUIDs. This method ensures that data from different breached systems remains isolated, allowing for more efficient management.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Voldemort interacts with Google Sheets using Google's API, relying on an embedded client ID, secret, and refresh token, all of which are stored in its encrypted configuration. This strategy offers malware a dependable and widely available C2 channel while minimizing the chances of its network communications being detected by security tools. Given that Google Sheets is commonly used in enterprise environments, blocking this service could be impractical, further reducing the likelihood of detection.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In 2023, the Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group APT41 was observed using Google Sheets as a C2 server, employing the red-teaming GC2 toolkit to facilitate this activity.

To defend against such campaigns, security firm Proofpoint recommends several measures: restricting access to external file-sharing services to trusted servers only, blocking connections to TryCloudflare when not actively required, and closely monitoring for suspicious PowerShell executions. These steps are advised to mitigate the risks posed by the Voldemort malware and similar threats.</div>

This campaign has sparked a heated debate between two tech giants, Apple and Google, over the best way to protect user privacy online.<p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Apple’s Stance on Privacy</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has long positioned itself as a champion of user <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/google-assures-privacy-with-gemini-ai.html" target="_blank">privacy</a>. In its latest campaign, Apple highlights the extensive use of tracking cookies by Google Chrome. These cookies, Apple claims, follow users across the web, collecting data on their browsing habits. Apple argues that Chrome’s Incognito mode, which many users rely on for private browsing, isn’t truly private. According to Apple, Incognito mode still allows websites to track user activity, albeit to a lesser extent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To counter these privacy concerns, Apple promotes its own browser, Safari, as a more secure alternative. Safari, Apple claims, uses Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) to limit the ability of advertisers to track users across websites. This feature, combined with other privacy-focused tools, makes Safari a more attractive option for users who prioritize their online privacy.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Google’s Response</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/google-assures-privacy-with-gemini-ai.html" target="_blank">Google</a>, on the other hand, has defended Chrome’s privacy practices. In response to Apple’s campaign, Google emphasized that Chrome is designed to keep user data safe and give users control over their privacy settings. Google points out that Chrome offers a range of privacy features, including the ability to block third-party cookies and manage site permissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google also highlights its commitment to transparency. The company regularly updates its privacy policies and provides users with clear information about how their data is collected and used. Google argues that this transparency, combined with robust privacy controls, makes Chrome a trustworthy choice for users.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Broader Context</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">This clash between Apple and Google is part of a larger conversation about online privacy. As more of our lives move online, the amount of data we generate has skyrocketed. This data is incredibly valuable to advertisers, who use it to target ads more effectively. However, this data collection has raised significant privacy concerns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many users are unaware of the extent to which their online activities are tracked. Even when using private browsing modes, such as Chrome’s Incognito mode, users may still be tracked by websites and advertisers. This has led to calls for greater transparency and stronger privacy protections.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the Right Browser</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">So, what does this mean for the average user? When choosing a browser, it’s important to consider your privacy needs. If you prioritize privacy and want to limit tracking as much as possible, Safari may be the better choice. Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention and other privacy features can help protect your data from advertisers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, if you value customization and control over your browsing experience, Chrome offers a range of privacy tools that can be tailored to your needs. Google’s transparency about its data collection practices also provides users with a clear understanding of how their data is used.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, the choice between Safari and Chrome comes down to personal preference. Both browsers have their strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will depend on your individual privacy needs and browsing habits.</p>

How New Android Malware Exploits NFC Technology" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Tap-to-pay technology, which allows users to make quick transactions with a simple tap of their smartphone, has become increasingly popular. However, with convenience comes <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/heres-how-to-safeguard-yourself-against.html" target="_blank">risk</a>. A recent discovery of a new Android malware by <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/ngate-android-malware-relays-nfc-traffic-to-steal-cash/" target="_blank">ESET</a>, known as NGate, has raised significant concerns about the security of tap-to-pay transactions. This blog will delve into how this malware operates, the potential risks it poses, and how users can protect themselves.</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Understanding NGate Malware</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/protecting-your-wallet-understanding.html" target="_blank">NGate </a>is a sophisticated piece of malware designed to exploit the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology used in tap-to-pay transactions. NFC allows devices to communicate wirelessly when they are close to each other, making it ideal for contactless payments. However, this same technology can be manipulated by malicious actors to steal sensitive financial information.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">How NGate Works</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The NGate malware is typically spread through social engineering and phishing tactics. Attackers often disguise the malware as legitimate banking apps or other trusted applications. Once a user unknowingly installs the malware, it begins to operate in the background, capturing sensitive information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most alarming features of NGate is its ability to clone contactless credit and debit cards. By exploiting the NFC feature, the malware can intercept and replicate the data transmitted during a tap-to-pay transaction. This cloned data can then be used by attackers to make unauthorized transactions, effectively draining the victim’s bank account.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Impact of NGate</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The implications of NGate are far-reaching. With the ability to clone contactless payment cards, attackers can carry out fraudulent transactions without the victim’s knowledge. This not only leads to financial loss but also undermines trust in tap-to-pay technology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the spread of NGate highlights the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. As technology advances, so do the methods used by attackers. This underscores the importance of staying vigilant and adopting robust security measures.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Protecting Yourself from NGate</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li style="text-align: justify;">Always download apps from official app stores like Google Play. Be cautious of apps that request unnecessary permissions or seem suspicious.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Use built-in security features on your smartphone, such as biometric authentication and two-factor authentication (2FA). These add an extra layer of protection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keep your device and apps updated. Security patches are often released to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Be cautious of unsolicited messages or emails that prompt you to download apps or provide personal information. Verify the source before taking any action.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regularly check your bank statements and transaction history for any unauthorized activity. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank immediately.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

In 2022, the parent company of Block, the peer-to-peer payment platform, failed to prevent unauthorised access to Cash App customer accounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Cash App agreed to a $15 million class action settlement in exchange. Even though it was an internal change, users' concerns about the app's security were not allayed, despite the fact that it was a positive step. 

To learn more about how to better defend themselves, users urged the cybersecurity specialists to provide some safety tips.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“One of the biggest problems with money apps like this is their popularity,” stated Neal O’Farrell, a digital security expert and CNET Money expert review board member. “Hackers follow the crowds, and the more people use these apps, the more time criminals will spend trying to exploit them.”&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Cash App actually includes an array of security safety features. The difficulty is that, while they can help you avoid fraudsters, they cannot always keep your data secure. O'Farrell observed that even the finest privacy safeguards can be undermined by an insider with access, as happened in the Cash App case. Whether you wish to avoid financial frauds on Cash App or protect your sensitive information after it has been disclosed, here are three security procedures you should take in addition to claiming any settlement money you are owed.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Secure your sign-on&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">By default, Cash App makes signing in much safer by sending a code to your email address or phone number each time you log in. But there's a catch: after logging in, you must manually sign out of your account; otherwise, you can access your account from your phone without a code. I've signed out and signed back in without a code, which could be a concern if someone gains access to your phone and the app.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">To be on the safe side, experts recommend logging out once you've finished completing transactions. You can add two-factor authentication as a second layer of account security, but you'll need to download a separate app, such as Google Authenticator.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Don’t send money to strangers</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">From romance scams to tax scams, there are numerous ways for perpetrators to trick you into sending money using Cash App or other payment apps. Experts recommended not to send money to strangers and always double-checking their phone number or email address before sending. If you mistakenly send money to the wrong person or discover you were scammed on a Cash App, banks will often refuse to refund your money.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">O'Farrell advises being wary of any messages you receive via payment apps. He frequently sees scams in which someone poses as a friend and asks for money or claims you owe them money. Others may attempt to steal access to your app and money by requesting that you verify your security code so that they can resolve a security issue with your account.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">A few things can help you figure out who you're giving money to. Cash App's Incoming Requests option, available under the Security &amp; Privacy menu, will only allow you to give money to a specific contact rather than everyone else on the app. You can also prevent people from finding your Cash App account by disabling the "$CashTag Cash.app" option in the same security page.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Monitor your transaction activity&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Beyond data security, it's critical to monitor your account's behaviour. To receive text messages and emails about your transactions, enable push alerts under Cash App's 'Notifications' option. This allows you to track all of your payment activities and keep an eye out for anything odd.</span></div></span>

The breach occurred when a hacker gained unauthorised access to the company’s Google G-Suite account, affecting all employees using the "@unicoin.com" domain. As a result, employees were locked out of critical Google services like Gmail and Google Drive, causing major disruptions in internal communication and file sharing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Unicoin detailed the extent of the attack, noting that the hacker not only altered account passwords but also restricted access to essential tools. The company managed to restore access to its systems by August 13, 2024. However, ongoing investigations have revealed additional issues stemming from the breach.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Several senior management email accounts were compromised, and further investigations uncovered anomalies in the personal information of employees and contractors. The company’s accounting department discovered several discrepancies, including an instance of identity forgery involving a contractor, which led to their immediate termination. Investigators are still determining whether these incidents are isolated or part of a larger cyber threat, potentially involving North Korean hackers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Financial Impact and Investigation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the severity of the breach, Unicoin has assured its stakeholders that there is no evidence of stolen funds or compromised cryptocurrency assets. While the situation is serious, the company stated that the attack has not immensely impacted its financial condition or operational performance. However, the full extent of the breach is still under review, and Unicoin has not ruled out the possibility of long-term financial consequences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In its SEC filing, Unicoin emphasised that no immediate financial losses had been identified. The company has committed to continuing its assessment of the situation and will report any significant impact in future filings if necessary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cybersecurity Concerns in the Cryptocurrency Sector</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unicoin's adherence to regulatory compliance stands out in the cryptocurrency industry, where oversight is often limited. The company consistently files reports with the SEC, demonstrating its commitment to transparency. With more than $500 million in Unicoins sold and a diverse portfolio that includes real estate and equity investments, the recent cyberattack is a telling event of how even the well regulated firms are not immune to combating such vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As investigations continue, the broader cryptocurrency industry will be closely monitoring Unicoin's response to this breach and the steps it takes to better amp up its cybersecurity defenses.</p>

The campaign, which began in July 2024, involved a series of deceptive emails promoting a supposed podcast titled “Exploring Jewish Life in the Muslim World.” The attackers masqueraded as representatives of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a legitimate American non-profit think tank focused on military and foreign affairs research.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On July 22, 2024, TA453 initiated contact with the target by sending an email from an address claiming to represent ISW’s Research Director. The email invited the recipient to participate in the podcast, a lure that successfully engaged the target. After initial correspondence, TA453 sent a DocSend URL containing a password-protected text file with a legitimate ISW podcast link. Researchers from Proofpoint believe this initial interaction was intended to build trust with the target, making them more likely to click on malicious links in future communications.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Following the initial lure, TA453 escalated their attack by sending a Google Drive URL that led to a ZIP archive. This archive contained a malicious LNK file, which, when opened, deployed the BlackSmith toolset, including the AnvilEcho PowerShell trojan. AnvilEcho is a sophisticated malware capable of intelligence gathering and data exfiltration. It employs encryption and network communication techniques to evade detection, integrating multiple capabilities within a single PowerShell script.

The trojan’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure is hosted on a domain linked to previous TA453 operations.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">AnvilEcho continuously fetches and executes commands from the remote server via its “Do-It” function, which handles various tasks, including network connectivity, file manipulation, screenshot capture, and audio recording. The “Redo-It” function, located at the end of the malware’s code, orchestrates these commands while also collecting system reconnaissance data such as antivirus status, operating system details, and user information.

According to researchers, the activities of TA453 are likely aimed at supporting intelligence collection for the Iranian government, specifically the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Intelligence Organization.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The tactics employed in this campaign bear a strong resemblance to those used by the Charming Kitten advanced persistent threat (APT) group, another Iranian cyber espionage unit. This operation is a classic example of multi-persona impersonation, where threat actors leverage legitimate links to build trust with victims before launching more harmful attacks.</div>

As part of this consequential development, Google has reassured users about the strong privacy and security measures surrounding their personal data, addressing growing concerns in the digital age.</span></div><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A Strong Focus on Privacy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In an exclusive interview with Aayush Ailawadi from Business Today, Sameer Samat, the President of Google’s Android Ecosystem, emphasised that user privacy is a top priority for the company. He explained that for any AI assistant, especially one as advanced as Gemini, safeguarding user data is crucial. According to Samat, Google's longstanding commitment to privacy and security has been a cornerstone of its approach to developing Android. He pointed out that for a personal assistant to be genuinely useful, it must also be trusted to keep conversations and data secure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Samat highlighted Google’s extensive experience and investment in artificial intelligence as a key advantage. He noted that Google controls every aspect of the AI process, from optimising the AI on users’ devices to managing it in the cloud. This comprehensive control ensures that the technology operates securely and efficiently across all platforms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the standout features of the Gemini AI, according to Samat, is its ability to handle personal queries and tasks entirely within Google’s ecosystem, without involving third-party providers. This approach minimises the risk of data exposure and ensures that users' information remains within the trusted boundaries of Google’s systems. Samat stressed upon the fine details of this feature for users who are particularly concerned about who has access to their personal data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>AI That Works for Everyday Life</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When asked about the broader implications of AI, Samat expressed his belief that AI technology should be open-source to better serve consumers. He emphasised that AI needs to be more than just a intricately designed tool— it should be something that genuinely helps people in their daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Samat shared an example from his personal experience to illustrate this point. While researching a used car purchase, he used Gemini AI to quickly gather important information that would typically take much longer to find. The AI assistant provided him with a concise list of questions to ask the mechanic, reducing what would have been an hour-long research task to just a few minutes. This practical application, Samat suggested, is what consumers really value—technology that saves them time and makes life easier.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google’s latest developments with Gemini AI signal a shift in focus from merely advancing technology to making it more accessible and beneficial for everyday use. This reflects a broader trend in the tech industry, where the goal is to ensure that innovations are not only cutting-edge but also practical and user-friendly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google’s Gemini AI aims to offer users a more secure and private experience while also being a pragmatic tool for daily tasks. With its focus on preserving privacy, controlled data management, and utility, Google is setting new standards for how AI can convenience our lives while keeping personal information safe.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

<title>Introducing TAXII 2.1 and a fond farewell to the TAXII 2.0 Server</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0GQBfYbb0frVtyhYLi3yiA.png" /></figure><p>As mentioned in our <a href="/mitre-attack/attack-2024-roadmap-8dfc46d1ad1b">2024 Roadmap</a> and the <a href="/mitre-attack/attack-v15-26685f300acc">v15 release blog</a>, we’re excited to introduce our new TAXII server and the latest addition to the ATT&amp;CK Workbench software suite: the <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 Server</a>. We’ve open-sourced the TAXII 2.1 code on <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub</a>, allowing you to set up your own servers within your organization <em>and </em>contribute to its improvement.</p><p>While you’re diving into the new 2.1 server, don’t forget: our TAXII 2.0 server is retiring on <strong>December 18.</strong></p><p><strong>To continue receiving updated ATT&amp;CK data, you’ll need to migrate from cti-taxii.mitre.org to attack-taxii.mitre.org. However, this migration may involve more than just a URL change. Given the transition from STIX 2.0 to STIX 2.1, the complexity of your migration will depend on how deeply your applications are integrated with STIX 2.0. We recommend assessing the impact on your systems and planning your migration accordingly.</strong></p><p><strong>Getting Started with TAXII 2.1</strong></p><p>Ready to explore the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 server?</p><ul><li>Visit our <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub repository</a> for the source code and detailed <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md">usage documentation</a>.</li><li>Leverage the <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-deployment">ATT&amp;CK Workbench Deployment</a> repository with <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-deployment/blob/main/compose.yaml">Docker Compose templates</a> to simplify setting up Workbench services and the TAXII 2.1 module (so you can pull the Docker images from GitHub and get started without building from source!).</li><li>Skip the source code and pull the TAXII 2.1 Docker image directly from the <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/pkgs/container/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub Container Registry</a>.</li><li>Access the server <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api-docs/">Swagger interface</a> and <a href="https://www.usebruno.com/">Bruno API Client</a> definitions (Bruno, similar to Postman, provides an easy way to interact with REST APIs). You can find our <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/tree/main/bruno">Bruno files here</a>.</li><li>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107514">OASIS TAXII 2.1 specification</a> to enhance your integration prowess.</li><li>Experience issues? Submit <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/issues/new/choose">specific requests or encounter issues</a> on GitHub.</li></ul><p><strong>Why TAXII 2.1?</strong></p><p>We know the ATT&amp;CK community has relied on our public TAXII 2.0 server, but it had issues like frequent outages. The TAXII 2.1 server addresses these problems with a more reliable and smooth experience. It’s built for scalability and stress-tested with real-world benchmarks from TAXII 2.0, ensuring you’re less likely to face major outages. Additionally, the new server introduces pagination, which was missing in TAXII 2.0. This means you can fetch smaller chunks of data instead of the entire ~20 MB STIX collection, speeding up the process and reducing data transfer costs.</p><p>A critical update to note is that our TAXII 2.1 server will exclusively host STIX 2.1 content moving forward. This change is part of our long-term strategy to shift away from STIX 2.0, aligning with the latest standards.</p><p>The new TAXII 2.1 server is also more powerful and capable than the previous version. We designed it to smoothly integrate with Workbench, making CTI management as seamless as possible. If you’re already using the ATT&amp;CK Workbench in your CTI workflows, you can easily edit and maintain CTI data without needing additional tools. The TAXII 2.1 server integrates with the ATT&amp;CK Workbench software suite, and can automatically synch with the Workbench REST API (the Workbench “back end”).</p><p>Workbench users can add objects, STIX collections, and bundles, and the TAXII 2.1 server will automatically make them available via its REST API. You don’t need to change your editor workflows — just bring the TAXII 2.1 server online in your Workbench container stack, and it will sync every 30 minutes by default (administrators can adjust this if needed). TAXII 2.1 is also optional, and you can continue using Workbench as usual without it.</p><p>Of note, the TAXII 2.1 specification outlines two “sharing models” for TAXII server implementations:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Collection model</strong>, where the TAXII server allows producers to host a set of CTI data that can be requested by consumers: TAXII Clients and Servers exchange information in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">request-response model</a>.</li><li>The <strong>Channel model</strong>, where the TAXII server uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe pattern</a> to allow producers to push data to many consumers and consumers to receive data from many producers.</li></ul><p>Given that Channels are still loosely defined in the TAXII specification, we decided to only implement the Collections model outlined in the TAXII 2.1 specification. However, we are open to adding support for a pub-sub model in future releases.</p><p><strong>A Brief Guide to Accessing Threat Intelligence Data</strong></p><p>With the new TAXII 2.1 server, you can still access your cyber threat intel in STIX format through the publicly accessible REST API, just like its <a href="http://cti-taxii.mitre.org/">predecessor</a> (cti-taxii.mitre.org) that’s been around for <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/att-ck-content-available-in-stix-2-0-via-public-taxii-2-0-server-317e5c41e214">over 6 years</a>. Even though this server has some sophisticated functionality, querying it is actually pretty simple. This following guide will show you the basics and help you easily get the threat intelligence data you need.</p><p>With TAXII 2.1 running on a RESTful API model and using standard HTTP requests, you can connect to the server using any HTTP client you like. This includes popular tools like curl, wget, httpie, or Postman. This flexibility allows you to seamlessly integrate TAXII 2.1 queries into your existing workflows and tools.</p><p>Let’s dive into how to structure these requests and interpret the responses.</p><p>Importantly, all TAXII 2.1 requests require a special Accept header:</p><pre>GET /taxii2/ HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1 Host: attack-taxii.mitre.org</pre><p>Here is an example of setting the Accept header using the curl tool:</p><pre>curl --request GET \<br />  --url https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/taxii2/ \<br />  --header ‘Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1’</pre><p>The request above sends a request to the TAXII server’s <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107497">Discovery endpoint</a>, which returns a list of available API roots that the TAXII server offers. Each API Root is the “root” URL of that particular instance of the TAXII API. Our TAXII server only hosts one API Root, which we can see clearly from the response body:</p><pre>{ <br />  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MITRE ATT&amp;CK TAXII 2.1&quot;, <br />  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This API Root contains TAXII 2.1 REST API endpoints that serve MITRE ATT&amp;CK STIX 2.1 data&quot;, <br />  &quot;default&quot;: &quot;api/v21&quot;, <br />  &quot;api_roots&quot;: [ <br />    &quot;api/v21&quot; <br />  ] <br />} </pre><p>Great! Now that we have the API Root, let’s see if we can query for a list of available <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107500">TAXII Collections</a>:</p><pre>curl --request GET \  <br />    --url https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/ \  <br />    --header 'Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1' </pre><p>The response should look something like the following:</p><pre>{<br />  “collections”: [<br />    {<br />      “id”: “x-mitre-collection — 1f5f1533-f617–4ca8–9ab4–6a02367fa019”,<br />      “title”: “Enterprise ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      “description”: “ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise provides a knowledge base of real-world adversary behavior targeting traditional enterprise networks. ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise covers the following platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, PRE, Office 365, Google Workspace, IaaS, Network, and Containers.”,<br />      “canRead”: true,<br />      “canWrite”: false,<br />      “mediaTypes”: [<br />        “application/taxii+json;version=2.1”,<br />        “application/taxii+json”<br />      ]<br />    },<br />    {<br />      id”: “x-mitre-collection — 90c00720–636b-4485-b342–8751d232bf09”,<br />      “title”: “ICS ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      …<br />    },<br />    {<br />      “id”: “x-mitre-collection — dac0d2d7–8653–445c-9bff-82f934c1e858”,<br />      “title”: “Mobile ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      …<br />    }<br />  ]<br />}</pre><p>The response lists three objects that match the main ATT&amp;CK domains: Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS. Of note, <em>TAXII Collections</em> and <em>STIX Collections</em> are different concepts — with TAXII Collections operating as versatile containers for CTI objects. For our MITRE ATT&amp;CK TAXII server, we’ve mapped each TAXII Collection directly to an ATT&amp;CK domain. This means querying a TAXII Collection from our server provides data from just one domain, simplifying the user experience and aligning with the ATT&amp;CK framework. While this mapping isn’t required by the TAXII protocol and other servers may organize collections differently, we chose this method to make our server more intuitive for the ATT&amp;CK community.</p><p>Now that we have our API Root and the available TAXII Collections, we’re ready to <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107539">retrieve some CTI objects</a>:</p><pre>curl --request GET \<br />  --url 'https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/x-mitre-collection--dac0d2d7-8653-445c-9bff-82f934c1e858/objects?limit=100' \<br />  --header ‘Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1’</pre><p>This request sends a request for the first 100 objects from the Enterprise ATT&amp;CK collection. The response should look something like this:</p><pre>{<br />  “more”: true,<br />  “next”: “1”,<br />  “objects”: [←100 →]<br />}</pre><p>If the ‘more’ property is set to true and the ‘next’ property is populated, then the client can paginate through the remaining records using the ‘next’ URL parameter along with the same original query options. So, we can request the second page of 100 objects by simply adding the ‘next=1’ query parameter to the original request:</p><pre>curl --request GET \  <br />    --url 'https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/x-mitre-collection--dac0d2d7-8653-445c-9bff-82f934c1e858/objects?limit=100&amp;next=1' \  <br />    --header 'Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1' </pre><p><strong>What’s Next for ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1</strong></p><p>We believe the release of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 server is a big step forward for threat intelligence sharing — and we have even more exciting integrations on our roadmap to make the TAXII experience even smoother:</p><ul><li>Workbench UI indicators that signal whether an object or collection is actively being shared through TAXII;</li><li>Workbench UI toggles that allow users to pause (or enable) the sharing objects and collections with TAXII;</li><li>Workbench role-based access controls (RBAC) for TAXII administration.</li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we continue to evolve our tools!</p><p>©2024 The MITRE Corporation.

<p><em>Guest Post by ATT&amp;CKcon 3.0 Keynote Speaker, Selena Larson</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Lt18htHq69IsEJ-3staO2w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Allan Pinkerton (Alexander Gardner — Library of Congress)</figcaption></figure><p>At the onset of the Civil War, a man whose name would eventually become synonymous with famous American detectives was reportedly providing false reports to the Union’s top general. Allan Pinkerton, who once successfully smuggled Abraham Lincoln into Washington, D.C. to avoid a rumored assassination attempt before he was even sworn in as president, acted as General George McClellan’s top intelligence officer. He was considered one of the best spymasters in the United States, responsible for effectively founding the nation’s first secret service.</p><p>In this piece, we’ll dive into some major intelligence reporting failures that dogged the renowned spymaster, how effective and concise intelligence reporting can change the course of history, and how the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework can help streamline and effectively communicate actionable threat intelligence.</p><p>Pinkerton was a detective when he first got to know Lincoln, but quickly became an indispensable intelligencer for the Union, first in the nation’s capital and then on the battlefield, working as a Civil War spymaster in 1861–1862. He operated a large team of spies who conducted counterespionage operations throughout Washington and information gathering expeditions into enemy territory. Pinkerton’s successes and failures are many — he made many of his own tactical intelligence failures that cost at least one spy his life during the Civil War — but there is a lot modern day intelligence analysts can learn from him. Specifically, from his intelligence reports.</p><p>According to author Douglas Waller, author of <em>Lincoln’s Spies</em>, Pinkerton was not very good at validating or communicating information, or transforming it from data into intelligence. Throughout his time operating a secret service on behalf of the Union, he collected a lot of information. But that information was frequently poorly vetted, based on single sources, or received from biased narrators. And often, the information was ineffectively communicated, or outright falsified.</p><p>By dissecting the failures of the nation’s first intelligence service spymaster, modern day threat intelligence analysts can learn how and why effective intelligence communication and report writing can have major effects on an organization — and, in some cases, have the potential to change the course of history.</p><p><strong>HiPPO Bias</strong></p><p>One of the biggest failures plaguing Pinkerton’s reporting apparatus was his desire to please his boss. General McClellan was famously slow to take any offensive actions against the enemy, holding a deep fear of failure that paralyzed him into inaction.</p><p>McClellan reportedly believed the Confederate military to be much larger than it actually was, in part due to the “intelligence” provided to him by his top spy. In fact, the relationship between Pinkerton and McClellan was more like a self-licking ice cream cone. While stationed with McClellan in Washington, Virginia, and Maryland, Pinkerton worked his network of operators to collect information on enemy troop movement and the size of the Confederate army. Sometimes information proved to be correct; other times it was outright false. But in most cases, Pinkerton cherry-picked data that supported his boss’s beliefs of an opposing force either equal to or out-sizing the Union military, ignoring accurate information on the small size of the Confederate forces and further inflating already inflated estimates to appeal to McClellan’s beliefs.</p><blockquote>“Loyal to the point of sycophancy, Pinkerton never doubted the general’s ability as a commander. Instead of serving his country or his president as a true intelligence officer, he made his friend happy.” <em>Lincoln’s Spies</em></blockquote><p>Pinkerton was demonstrating Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO) bias, or the idea that analysts collect and disseminate information in a way that favors or appeals to existing beliefs within an organization, typically driven by leadership.</p><blockquote>“Pinkerton admitted that he and McClellan had conspired to cook the books. In a later November 15 letter to the general, Pinkerton explained that his estimate of Confederate strength ‘was made large, as intimated to you at the time, so as to be sure to cover the entire number of the Enemy that our army was to meet.’ The controversial sentence appeared to show that before Pinkerton issued his October 4 report [reporting double the total number of actual Confederate troops], he and McClellan agreed to deliberately inflate the confederate numbers to be sure they included troops Pinkerton’s agents might not know about. ”</blockquote><p>This can be a frequent issue for analysts tasked with certain objectives and directives, but it can also be detrimental to the organization’s decision making and ultimate success. For example, if leadership believes that Russian state-sponsored threats are the most important and likely the most targeted to their organization, defenders and analysts will be spending more key resources hunting for and defending against these threats, with the potential to miss or disregard tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with other relevant, but different, activity.</p><p><em>Use data to build your case.</em> In her 2019 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba5jh8uhTBU&amp;ab_channel=mitrecorp">ATT&amp;CKcon 2.0 keynote</a>, Google’s Toni Gidwandi explained how the MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix can be a “powerful corrective” to HiPPO bias and enable security teams to understand what is happening in the landscape and how it translates to impacts on their organizations.</p><p>Beyond indicators of compromise (IOCs), ATT&amp;CK allows defenders to visualize threat behaviors in a digestible way to show what TTPs are observed and impacting an organization versus what stakeholders expect or want to focus on.</p><p>Analysts can create mappings of MITRE ATT&amp;CK to malware, malware families and techniques observed in their environment. Subsequently, analysts can craft search queries to help with threat hunting and detection efforts. For example, mapping and searching on specific execution techniques such as certutil or BITSAdmin which are being used to download follow-on payloads.</p><p>By identifying the most impactful behaviors, and possible gaps in defense, security teams can prioritize hunting, detection, and response based on observable threat behaviors rather than requests or knee-jerk reactions from stakeholders.</p><p>Ultimately, Pinkerton’s analysis failed his organization — his reporting coupled with McClellan’s ego and general aversion to taking decisive action may have cost the Union military successes early on in the Civil War.</p><p><strong>Reporting Is Not Letter Writing</strong></p><p>In addition to some reports containing easily disproved inaccuracies, Pinkerton and many of his staff typically wrote very long reports, with much of the key details hidden among flowery language, tens of pages deep. Effectively communicating actionable intelligence is a common issue with cyber threat intelligence dissemination, and it’s nice to know our predecessors experienced similar flaws.</p><blockquote>“He always wrote [intelligence reports] in the form of a letter, and they began with a flowery opening officers of the day commonly used, such as ‘I have the honor to report…’” <em>Lincoln’s Spies</em></blockquote><p>Pinkerton also reportedly doodled in the margins, drawing cartoon fingers to indicate what the most important parts of the reports were.</p><p>Succinctly and effectively communicating intelligence through written reports is difficult, but there are some key characteristics of good intelligence reporting that can help improve efficiency, streamline the writing process, and provide stakeholders with relevant data.</p><p><em>Put the most important information first</em>.<strong> </strong>Frequently referred to as the stating Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF), immediately detailing the findings of your reporting and why they matter to an organization is crucial. This can be considered the “So What?” portion of the report. Most people — especially key stakeholders like executive audiences — will not read every word of an in-depth intelligence report. It is therefore important to ensure that in the short amount of time allotted for consuming reporting, they can read and understand the points that matter most.</p><p><em>Be concise</em>. Pinkerton didn’t need flowery language and neither do you. I have said this before, but I firmly believe people should not require a thesaurus to read and understand threat intelligence reporting. The report should contain relevant information such as: What happened, why does it matter, and what can we do about it? Items such as anecdotes, extraneous clauses, and navel-gazing are generally unnecessary.</p><p><em>Consider your audience</em>.<strong> </strong>Executives likely don’t need details of deconstructed malware. Security operations analysts likely don’t need geopolitical analysis of events occurring in places where the business does not operate. Threat intelligence analysts should always be aware of who is reading reports and why. Make sure you know the answer to: What decisions are being made based on this data? Gathering intelligence requirements and understanding how your audience is using intelligence throughout the organization can help shape and improve your reporting.</p><p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK has become the universal framework for threat actor TTPs, and can be used to quickly distill and communicate threat intelligence. But where and how it’s used varies based on the audience receiving the information.</p><p>For example, in February 2022, intelligence agencies from the United States and United Kingdom published <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Joint-Sandworm-Advisory.pdf">a joint advisory</a> on a new malware called Cyclops Blink targeting small office/home office routers attributed to the Russian state actor Sandworm. The 10-page advisory was designed as an overview of the malware and related threats, documenting Sandworm’s historic and current activity and its relevance in the overall threat landscape. In this report, the MITRE ATT&amp;CK mappings were presented at the end, to add additional insight and technical details to an otherwise fairly high-level, strategic report. However, in a companion <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyclops-Blink-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf">malware analysis report</a> published by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, the ATT&amp;CK mappings were presented on page three of 20, demonstrating the framework can be used to summarize tactical threat intelligence.</p><p>Like any tool, where and how you use MITRE ATT&amp;CK to document TTPs is crucial for an audience’s understanding of the threats.</p><p><strong>Always Evaluate OSINT</strong></p><p>While Pinkerton collected massive amounts of information and distributed it whole cloth to his superiors, there was little explanation given to where the information came from or its validity.</p><blockquote>“Rarely did Pinkerton include in his reports an evaluation of a source’s reliability beyond a general impression he had of it.” <em>Lincoln’s Spies</em></blockquote><p>Pinkerton was operating based on human intelligence, information collected by his operatives in the field. Much of it was gossip; some of it reached his ears by a convoluted game of telephone. A lot of it was reliable and accurate — some of it was not.</p><p>As intelligence analysts, understanding and evaluating the veracity of information is crucial to communicating and acting on it. Primary sources of intelligence — the data we collect on our networks — we typically understand to be reliable. But we also rely on open source intelligence (OSINT) to form a whole picture of adversary threat behaviors and an understanding of the threat landscape.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad information on the internet. The online <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/02/1046646/the-propaganda-war-has-eclipsed-cyberwar-in-ukraine/">claims</a> of unconfirmed hacking campaigns during the ongoing war in Ukraine is an excellent example of information spreading far and wide without validation, and likely making it into intelligence briefings on the conflict.</p><p>There are multiple questions analysts should ask themselves when reviewing third-party data to support original research, for example:</p><ul><li>What is the visibility of the individual or organization?</li><li>What evidence are their claims based on?</li><li>Is this evidence available to me?</li><li>Does this overlap with known threat activity?</li><li><em>Cui bono</em>? Or, who benefits and how?</li></ul><p>There is always inherent bias in visibility; vendors or anti-virus companies will only have data from the organizations and geographies in which it is used. If the visibility is limited, it might not be an effective source for verifying or supporting existing hypotheses. Being able to independently validate or invalidate evidence provided in open-source artifacts with internal tools and resources can help further your own investigations or reporting. And finally, considering political, financial, economic, etc. motivations in external reporting can help identify potential biases in reporting and inform your assessments of a source’s reliability.</p><p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework exists in part to help answer these questions, especially for providing validated, authoritative third-party intelligence reporting.</p><p><strong>A Dictionary of Threats</strong></p><p>While the United States was fighting the bloodiest war in the nation’s history, an idea was blossoming among philologists in the United Kingdom. English speakers had colonized many parts of the world, with English customs and culture forcing itself into existing cultures and communities, with paltry existing resources standardizing vocabulary. Academics in the UK argued that there should be a single authoritative resource to define the English language, documenting and establishing the correct form of communications.</p><p>Formally <a href="https://archive.org/details/onsomedeficienci00trenrich/page/n7/mode/2up">proposed in 1857</a>, what would become known as the Oxford English Dictionary would eventually achieve its goal of standardizing English words beginning in 1884. It was a massive undertaking that brought together academics, historians, and the English-speaking public to collect and define words. In fact, the dictionary could not have been written without considerable public assistance.</p><p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework has become the universal dictionary of TTPs, in large part due to contributions from analysts and researchers around the globe. According to MITRE, 155 people contributed to the framework in 2021. (In fact, this year my Proofpoint colleague Michael Raggi contributed an update to ATT&amp;CK <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/">Technique T1221</a> to include a novel <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/injection-new-black-novel-rtf-template-inject-technique-poised-widespread">RTF template injection technique</a> observed in use by multiple threat actors.)</p><p>The authoritative nature of the framework has allowed analysts to verify open-source reporting, and better understand the nature of threat actors. It has also allowed researchers to more effectively document and communicate threat behaviors, prioritize detections, and improve defense. By standardizing how we identify and classify threat behaviors, actionable intelligence can be more easily communicated to a variety of stakeholders.</p><p>Pinkerton did not have a reliable threat intelligence framework or dictionary off which to operate; indeed he was trailblazing the creation of a secret service that had never before existed. And while his early work helped pave the way for modern day spying and the development of the Secret Service, he and his team were far from perfect. But by examining the intelligence reporting failures documented by modern historians, threat intelligence analysts can be better prepared when they too one day may be called on to help change the course of history.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=35be8d12884" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/intelligence-failures-of-lincolns-top-spies-what-cti-analysts-can-learn-from-the-civil-war-35be8d12884">Intelligence Failures of Lincoln’s Top Spies: What CTI Analysts Can Learn From the Civil War</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack">MITRE ATT&amp;CK®</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>
Your smartphone holds a lot of your personal information to help you get things done every day. On Android, we are seamlessly integrating the latest artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, like Gemini as a trusted assistant – capable of handling life's essential tasks. As such, ensuring your privacy and security on Android is paramount. As a pioneer in responsible AI and cutting-edge privacy technologies like <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/trust-in-transparency-private-compute.html">Private Compute Core</a> and <a href="https://research.google/blog/federated-learning-collaborative-machine-learning-without-centralized-training-data/">federated learning</a>, we made sure our approach to the assistant experience with Gemini on Android is aligned with our existing <a href="https://safety.google/cybersecurity-advancements/saif/">Secure AI framework</a>, <a href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/">AI Principles</a> and <a href="https://safety.google/principles/">Privacy Principles</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We’ve always safeguarded your data with an integrated stack of world-class secure infrastructure and technology, delivering end-to-end protection in a way that only Google can. From privacy on-device when handling sensitive data to the world’s best cloud infrastructure, here are six key ways we keep your information private and protected.
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>We don’t hand off to a third-party AI provider.</strong>
<p>

    Gemini Apps can help you with complex, personal tasks from creating workout routines to helping you get started on a resume. And it does the hard work for you all within Google's ecosystem. The core processing is done by Gemini within Google's secure cloud infrastructure and there are no handoffs to third-party chatbots or AI providers that you may not know or trust. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>On-device AI privacy for sensitive tasks, even when offline.</strong>
<p>

    For some AI features, like <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/gemini-nano-google-pixel/">Summarize in Recorder</a> on Pixel, that benefit from additional data privacy or processing efficiency, we utilize on-device AI. <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/">Gemini Nano</a>, the first multimodal model designed to run on mobile devices, delivers on-device AI processing for some of your most sensitive tasks without relying on cloud connectivity. You can enjoy features like summarizing text even when you’re offline. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>World-class cloud infrastructure that is secure by default, private by design.</strong>
<p>

    For AI tasks that use data already in the cloud or have complex demands that require more processing power than what’s possible on-device, we use Google’s highly secure cloud infrastructure. Backed by Google’s world-class security and privacy infrastructure and processes, these data centers benefit from the same robust defenses that have kept Google products safe for billions of users for more than 20 years. So you can ask Gemini to find details in your lease agreement saved in your Google Drive and that data is protected by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/production-services-protection">advanced monitoring against unauthorized access</a> or misuse. We also enforce strict software supply chain controls to ensure that only approved and verified code runs in our cloud environment.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>Control how you interact with Gemini Apps.</strong><p>

    We've designed the Gemini Apps experience with careful consideration for how you access it and control it. You can review and choose the Gemini experiences you want – when and where they’re needed most. And at any time, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13666746?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;oco=1#zippy=%2Cin-the-gemini-mobile-apps">review your Gemini Apps chats</a>, pin them, <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13278892?sjid=2800487149694713106-NC">or delete them</a>. Android also gives you control over how apps such as Gemini respond when your device is locked.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>Pioneering new privacy technologies.</strong><p>

    We’re always working to develop new ways to keep your data even more private and secure. We continue to innovate in advancing privacy-preserving technologies, like <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/README.md">sealed computing technology</a>, which can be used to process sensitive workloads for enhanced privacy in a secure cloud enclave. Sealed computing ensures no one, including Google, can access the data. It can be thought of as extending the user’s device and its security boundaries into our cloud infrastructure, providing a virtual smartphone in the sky.</p>
</li><li><p><b>A new level of transparency.</b><br /><br />Transparency is in Android’s open-source DNA.&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/binary_transparency/overview">Android binary transparency</a>&nbsp;already allows anyone to verify the operating system code against a transparency log to ensure it hasn't been tampered with, much like matching fingerprint biometrics to confirm someone's identity. Binary transparency is extended in sealed computing environments to include&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/README.md#remote-attestation">reproducible builds</a>. This ensures anyone can rebuild the trusted firmware base and verify that the resulting binaries match what is remotely attested as running in production and published in public transparency logs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Our Commitment to Safeguarding Your Data</strong></h3>Just like with all Google products, we believe you should be able to enjoy the benefits of Android without having to worry about security and privacy. That's why we invest so much in building world-class protections into our products and services from the start. We look forward to continuing to make AI helpful and intuitive, allowing you to focus on what matters most, while we take care of safeguarding your data.
<p></p>
<p>
<strong><em>Keep a lookout for more information about our end-to-end approach to AI privacy in an upcoming whitepaper. </em></strong></p>

<title>Post-Quantum Cryptography: Standards and Progress</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Royal Hansen, VP, Privacy, Safety and Security Engineering, Google, and Phil Venables, VP, TI Security & CISO, Google Cloud</span>

<p>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) just released three finalized standards for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) covering public key encapsulation and two forms of digital signatures. In progress since 2016, this achievement represents a major milestone towards standards development that will keep information on the Internet secure and confidential for many years to come. 
</p>
<p>
Here's a brief overview of what PQC is, how Google is using PQC, and how other organizations can adopt these new standards. You can also read more about PQC and Google's role in the standardization process <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-is-preparing-for-a-post-quantum-world/?e=48754805">in this 2022 post from Cloud CISO Phil Venables</a>.
</p>
<h2>What is PQC?</h2>


<p>
Encryption is central to keeping information confidential and secure on the Internet. Today, most Internet sessions in modern browsers are encrypted to prevent anyone from eavesdropping or altering the data in transit. Digital signatures are also crucial to online trust, from code signing proving that programs haven't been tampered with, to signals that can be relied on for confirming online identity.
</p>
<p>
Modern encryption technologies are secure because the computing power required to "crack the code" is very large; larger than any computer in existence today or the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, that's an advantage that won't last forever. Practical large-scale <a href="https://quantumai.google/discover/whatisqc">quantum computers</a> are still years away, but computer scientists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">have known for decades</a> that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) could break existing forms of asymmetric key cryptography.
</p>
<p>
PQC is the effort to defend against that risk, by defining standards and collaboratively implementing new algorithms that will resist attacks by both classical and quantum computers.
</p>
<p>
You don't need a quantum computer to use post-quantum cryptography, or to prepare. All of the standards released by NIST today run on the classical computers we currently use.
</p>
<h2>How is encryption at risk?</h2>


<p>
While a CRQC doesn't exist yet, devices and data from today will still be relevant in future. Some risks are already here:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Stored Data</strong> Through an attack known as <em>Store Now, Decrypt Later</em>, encrypted data captured and saved by attackers is stored for later decryption, with the help of as-yet unbuilt quantum computers

<li><strong>Hardware Products</strong> Defenders must ensure that future attackers cannot forge a digital signature and implant compromised firmware, or software updates, on pre-quantum devices that are still in use
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more information on CRQC-related risks, see our <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">PQC Threat Model post</a>.
</p>
<h2>How can organizations prepare for PQC migrations?</h2>


<p>
Migrating to new cryptographic algorithms is often a slow process, even when weaknesses affect widely-used crypto systems, because of organizational and logistical challenges in fully completing the transition to new technologies. For example, NIST deprecated SHA-1 hashing algorithms in 2011 and recommends complete phase-out by 2030.
</p>
<p>
That’s why it's crucial to take steps now to improve organizational preparedness, independent of PQC, with the goal of making your transition to PQC easier.
</p>
<p>
These <em>crypto agility</em> best practices can be enacted anytime:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Cryptographic inventory</strong> Understanding where and how organizations are using cryptography includes knowing what cryptographic algorithms are in use, and critically, managing key material safely and securely 

<li><strong>Key rotation</strong> Any new cryptographic system will require the ability to generate new keys and move them to production without causing outages. Just like testing recovery from backups, regularly testing key rotation should be part of any good resilience plan

<li><strong>Abstraction layers</strong> You can use a tool like <a href="https://developers.google.com/tink">Tink, Google's multi-language, cross-platform open source library</a>, designed to make it easy for non-specialists to use cryptography safely, and to switch between cryptographic algorithms without extensive code refactoring

<li><strong>End-to-end testing</strong> PQC algorithms have different properties. Notably, public keys, ciphertexts, and signatures are significantly larger. Ensure that all layers of the stack function as expected
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04623-2">2022 paper "Transitioning organizations to post-quantum cryptography"</a> provides additional recommendations to help organizations prepare and this <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6182336647790592/cryptographic-agility-and-key-rotation">recent post from the Google Security Blog</a> has more detail on cryptographic agility and key rotation.
</p>
<h2>Google's PQC Commitments</h2>


<p>
Google takes these risks seriously, and is taking steps on multiple fronts. Google began <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">testing PQC in Chrome in 2016</a> and has been <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/why-google-now-uses-post-quantum-cryptography-for-internal-comms?e=48754805">using PQC to protect internal communications</a> since 2022. In May 2024, <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/advancing-our-amazing-bet-on-asymmetric.html">Chrome enabled ML-KEM by default</a> for TLS 1.3 and QUIC on desktop. ML-KEM is also enabled on Google servers. Connections between Chrome Desktop and Google's products, such as Cloud Console or Gmail, are already experimentally protected with post-quantum key exchange.
</p>
<p>
Google engineers have contributed to the standards released by NIST, as well as <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/80492.html">standards created by ISO</a>, and have submitted Internet Drafts to the IETF for <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-trust-expr/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1719337176044717&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GculUbK3_3Hgsv6w-VE-q">Trust Expressions</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1719337176044781&amp;usg=AOvVaw1S2vxLo4QsJsIuaTIYmUy8">Merkle Tree Certificates</a>, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wiggers-hbs-state/">managing state for hash-based signatures</a>. <a href="https://developers.google.com/tink">Tink</a>, Google's open source library that provides secure and easy-to-use cryptographic APIs, already provides experimental PQC algorithms in C++, and our engineers are working with partners to produce formally verified PQC implementations that can be used at Google, and beyond. 
</p>
<p>
As we make progress on our own PQC transition, Google will continue to provide PQC updates on Google services, with updates to come from Android, Chrome, Cloud, and others.

<title>Keeping your Android device safe from text message fraud</title>

<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/keeping-your-android-device-safe-from.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Nataliya Stanetsky and Roger Piqueras Jover, Android Security & Privacy Team</span>

<p>
<a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/cell-site-simulators-imsi-catchers">Cell-site simulators</a>, also known as False Base Stations (FBS) or Stingrays, are radio devices that mimic real cell sites in order to lure mobile devices to connect to them. These devices are commonly used for security and privacy attacks, such as <a href="https://fight.mitre.org/techniques/FGT5012">surveillance</a> and <a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/609.html">interception of communications</a>. In recent years, carriers have started reporting new types of abuse perpetrated with FBSs for the purposes of financial fraud.
</p>
<p>
In particular, there is increasingly more evidence of the exploitation of weaknesses in cellular communication standards leveraging cell-site simulators to inject SMS phishing messages directly into smartphones. This method to inject messages entirely bypasses the carrier network, thus bypassing all the sophisticated network-based anti-spam and anti-fraud filters. Instances of this new type of fraud, which carriers refer to as SMS Blaster fraud, have been reported in Vietnam, France, Norway, Thailand and multiple other countries.
</p>
<p>
GSMA’s Fraud and Security Group (<a href="https://www.gsma.com/get-involved/working-groups/fraud-security-group">FASG</a>) has developed a briefing paper for GSMA members to raise awareness of SMS Blaster fraud and provide guidelines and mitigation recommendations for carriers, OEMs and other stakeholders. The <a href="https://membergateway.sharepoint.com/sites/wg-FASG-FSAG/SitePages/SMS-Blasters-Briefing-Paper.aspx">briefing paper</a>, available for GSMA members only, calls out some Android-specific recommendations and features that can help effectively protect our users from this new type of fraud.
</p>
<h2>What are SMS Blasters?</h2>


<p>
SMS Blaster is the term that global carriers use to refer to FBS and cell-site simulators operated unlawfully with the goal of disseminating (blast) SMS payloads. The most common use case is to leverage these devices to inject <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/what-is/phishing/smishing.html">Smishing</a> (SMS phishing) payloads into user devices. Fraudsters typically do this by driving around with portable FBS devices, and there have even been reports of fraudsters <a href="https://commsrisk.com/bangkok-police-arrest-hong-kong-smishing-scammers-carrying-an-imsi-catcher-backpack-through-shopping-malls/">carrying these devices in their backpacks</a>.
</p>
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfR73BM7TyPriNjm6LveRbEAUVjqtGAXXP4U2FzpRvk1EA63qxYw5Y3sn750rqlB0VwpvNEy0fqniiDOUjXCHHImFHJzZtWm_TjE3MB7W_ICudUMjRvOjcw0C_Vtixr_DwBPLMfX5FJi-43wSFuvnoHXvmm475X4rFf5UtxDrlcQOHvjNTjqrqv93JpNob/s1600/Artboard%201%20copy@2x.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfR73BM7TyPriNjm6LveRbEAUVjqtGAXXP4U2FzpRvk1EA63qxYw5Y3sn750rqlB0VwpvNEy0fqniiDOUjXCHHImFHJzZtWm_TjE3MB7W_ICudUMjRvOjcw0C_Vtixr_DwBPLMfX5FJi-43wSFuvnoHXvmm475X4rFf5UtxDrlcQOHvjNTjqrqv93JpNob/s1600/Artboard%201%20copy@2x.png" /></a></div>
  
The method is straightforward and replicates known techniques to trick mobile devices to an attacker-controlled 2G network. SMS Blasters expose a fake LTE or 5G network which executes a single function: downgrading the user’s connection to a legacy 2G protocol. The same device also exposes a fake 2G network, which lures all the devices to connect to it. At this point, attackers abuse the well known <a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/attachments/1783_101228.27C3.GSM-Sniffing.Nohl_Munaut.pdf">lack of mutual authentication in 2G</a> and force connections to be unencrypted, which enables a complete Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) position to inject SMS payloads.
</p>
<p>
SMS Blasters are sold on the internet and do not require deep technical expertise. They are simple to set up and ready to operate, and users can easily configure them to imitate a particular carrier or network using a mobile app. Users can also easily configure and customize the SMS payload as well as its metadata, including for example the sender number.
</p>
<p>
SMS Blasters are very appealing to fraudsters given their great return on investment. Spreading SMS phishing messages commonly yields a small return as it is very difficult to get these messages to fly undetected by sophisticated anti-spam filters. A very small subset of messages eventually reach a victim. In contrast, injecting messages with an SMS blaster entirely bypasses the carrier network and its anti-fraud and anti-spam filters, guaranteeing that all messages will reach a victim. Moreover, using an FBS the fraudster can control all fields of the message. One can make the message look like it is coming from the legitimate SMS aggregator of a bank, for example. In a recent attack that impacted hundreds of thousands of devices, the <a href="https://commsrisk.com/paris-imsi-catcher-mistaken-for-bomb-was-actually-used-for-health-insurance-sms-phishing-scam/">messages masqueraded as a health insurance notice</a>.
</p>
<p>
Although the type of abuse carriers are uncovering recently is financial fraud, there is precedent for the use of rogue cellular base stations to disseminate malware, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/chinese-trojan-detected-spreading-through-fake-base-stations/">for example injecting phishing messages with a url to download the payload</a>. It is important to note that users are still vulnerable to this type of fraud as long as mobile devices support 2G, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/android-14-introduces-first-of-its-kind.html">regardless of the status of 2G in their local carrier</a>.
</p>
<h2>Android protects users from phishing and fraud</h2>


<p>
There are a number of Android-only security features that can significantly mitigate, or in some cases fully block, the impact of this type of fraud.
</p>
<p>
Android 12 introduced a user option to <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/android-12-release#2g-toggle">disable 2G</a> at the modem level, a feature <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/10/pixel-6-setting-new-standard-for-mobile.html">first adopted by Pixel</a>. This option, if used, completely mitigates the risk from SMS Blasters. This feature has been available since Android 12 and requires devices to conform to Radio HAL 1.6+.
</p>
<p>
  
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3_dR8TI2qfFUh0l4JNScxbSINRIdE0pGvWOfviDTszhVXsYz_vWUsVYhPKFMSzGTFgSfof9noUI8FEQOB2UxHyxxegHMQH-UieKoAw7TqNKvvgcfh8jaaCDmb9HgbUEXyBjXgw_wp7jSjWR32eQdQNq-izO1BlVHhf2fG8AExf_-bjwh0HTxakXJqtNdL/s1600/Artboard%201%20copy%202@2x.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3_dR8TI2qfFUh0l4JNScxbSINRIdE0pGvWOfviDTszhVXsYz_vWUsVYhPKFMSzGTFgSfof9noUI8FEQOB2UxHyxxegHMQH-UieKoAw7TqNKvvgcfh8jaaCDmb9HgbUEXyBjXgw_wp7jSjWR32eQdQNq-izO1BlVHhf2fG8AExf_-bjwh0HTxakXJqtNdL/s1600/Artboard%201%20copy%202@2x.png" /></a></div>
<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/whatsnew/android-14-release#disable-null-ciphers">Android also has an option to disable null ciphers</a> as a key protection because it is strictly necessary for the 2G FBS to configure a <a href="https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FS.35-v3.0.pdf">null cipher</a> (e.g. <a href="https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FS.35-v3.0.pdf">A5/0</a>) in order to inject an SMS payload. This security feature launched with Android 14 requires devices that implement radio HAL 2.0 or above.
</p>
<p>
Android also provides effective protections that specifically tackles SMS spam and phishing, regardless of whether the delivery channel is an SMS Blaster. Android has <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-scam-and-phishing-protection/">built-in spam protection</a> that helps to identify and block spam SMS messages. Additional protection is provided through <a href="https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging">RCS for Business</a>, a feature that helps users identify legitimate SMS messages from businesses. RCS for Business messages are marked with a blue checkmark, which indicates that the message has been verified by Google. 
</p>
<p>
We advocate leveraging a couple of important Google security features which are available on Android, namely Safe Browsing and Google Play Protect. As an additional layer of protection, <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> built-in on Android devices protects 5 billion devices globally and helps warn the users about potentially risky sites, downloads and extensions which could be phishing and malware-based. 
</p>
<p>
Let’s say a user decides to download an app from the Play store but the app contains code that is malicious or harmful, users are protected by <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en">Google Play Protect</a> which is a security feature that scans apps for malware and other threats. It also warns users about potentially harmful apps before they are installed.

<h2>Android’s commitment to security and privacy</h2>


<p>
Android is committed to providing users with a safe and secure mobile experience. We are constantly working to improve our security features and protect users from phishing, fraud, and other threats.
</p>
<p>
Working with global carriers and other OEMs through the GSMA to support the ecosystem in the development and adoption of further cellular security and privacy features is a priority area for Android. We look forward to partnering with ecosystem partners in further raising the security bar in this space to protect mobile users from threats like SMS blasters.
</p>

<title>Improving the security of Chrome cookies on Windows</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/improving-security-of-chrome-cookies-on.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/improving-security-of-chrome-cookies-on.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Will Harris, Chrome Security Team</span>

<p>
Cybercriminals using cookie theft <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/a-year-in-the-cybersecurity-trenches-with-mandiant-managed-defense">infostealer</a> malware continue to pose a risk to the safety and security of our users. We already have a number of initiatives in this area including <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/building-security-into-redesigned.html">Chrome’s download protection</a> using Safe Browsing, <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/04/fighting-cookie-theft-using-device.html">Device Bound Session Credentials</a>, and Google’s account-based threat detection to flag the use of stolen cookies. Today, we’re announcing another layer of protection to make Windows users safer from this type of malware.
</p>
<p>
Like other software that needs to store secrets, Chrome currently secures sensitive data like cookies and passwords using the strongest techniques the OS makes available to us - on macOS this is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/">Keychain services</a>, and on Linux we use a system provided wallet such as kwallet or gnome-libsecret. On Windows, Chrome uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI) which protects the data at rest from other users on the system or cold boot attacks. However, the DPAPI does not protect against malicious applications able to execute code as the logged in user - which infostealers take advantage of.
</p>
<p>
In Chrome 127 we are introducing a new protection on Windows that improves on the DPAPI by providing <strong>Application-Bound (App-Bound) </strong>Encryption primitives. Rather than allowing any app running as the logged in user to access this data, Chrome can now encrypt data tied to app identity, similar to how the Keychain operates on macOS.
</p>
<p>
We will be migrating each type of secret to this new system starting with cookies in Chrome 127. In future releases we intend to expand this protection to passwords, payment data, and other persistent authentication tokens, further protecting users from infostealer malware.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How it works</strong>
</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpjkAClX2VvgsIhLi2zAmvRwVMPEeJqUhqisKHIKxbfGAwh8p8-V7Ixct5azzn_jYfJYo2izWnGcbkVh3cabbCLVQQQsJAJagvFPCFJsx4MibauJqnLVymQYdhdGGc53q3wSJSeTPQ6vyxXosJ-tJRKuaaoV7_J_E2KB9glSZ1m3NSEwEBj-duevgROHlM/s1416/Screenshot%202024-07-26%202.15.06%20PM.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpjkAClX2VvgsIhLi2zAmvRwVMPEeJqUhqisKHIKxbfGAwh8p8-V7Ixct5azzn_jYfJYo2izWnGcbkVh3cabbCLVQQQsJAJagvFPCFJsx4MibauJqnLVymQYdhdGGc53q3wSJSeTPQ6vyxXosJ-tJRKuaaoV7_J_E2KB9glSZ1m3NSEwEBj-duevgROHlM/s16000/Screenshot%202024-07-26%202.15.06%20PM.png" /></a></div><p>
App-Bound Encryption relies on a privileged service to verify the identity of the requesting application. During encryption, the App-Bound Encryption service encodes the app's identity into the encrypted data, and then verifies this is valid when decryption is attempted. If another app on the system tries to decrypt the same data, it will fail.
</p>
<p>
Because the App-Bound service is running with system privileges, attackers need to do more than just coax a user into running a malicious app. Now, the malware has to gain system privileges, or inject code into Chrome, something that legitimate software shouldn't be doing. This makes their actions more suspicious to antivirus software – and more likely to be detected. Our other recent initiatives such as providing <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/detecting-browser-data-theft-using.html">event logs</a> for cookie decryption work in tandem with this protection, with the goal of further increasing the cost and risk of detection to attackers attempting to steal user data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Enterprise Considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>
Since malware can bypass this protection by running elevated, enterprise environments that do not grant their users the ability to run downloaded files as Administrator are particularly helped by this protection - malware cannot simply request elevation privilege in these environments and is forced to use techniques such as injection that can be more easily detected by endpoint agents.
</p>
<p>
App-Bound Encryption strongly binds the encryption key to the machine, so will not function correctly in environments where Chrome profiles roam between multiple machines. We encourage enterprises who wish to support roaming profiles to follow current <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7349337">best practices</a>. If it becomes necessary, App-Bound encryption can be configured using the new <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#ApplicationBoundEncryptionEnabled">ApplicationBoundEncryptionEnabled</a> policy.
</p>
<p>
To further help detect any incompatibilities, Chrome emits an event when a failed verification occurs. The Event is ID 257 from 'Chrome' source in the Application log.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
App-Bound Encryption increases the cost of data theft to attackers and also makes their actions far noisier on the system. It helps defenders draw a clear line in the sand for what is acceptable behavior for other apps on the system. As the malware landscape continually evolves we are keen to continue engaging with others in the security community on improving detections and strengthening operating system protections, such as stronger app isolation primitives, for any bypasses.

<title>Building security into the redesigned Chrome downloads experience</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/building-security-into-redesigned.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/building-security-into-redesigned.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Jasika Bawa, Lily Chen, and Daniel Rubery, Chrome Security</span>

<p>
Last year, we introduced a <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/redesigning-chrome-downloads-to-keep.html">redesign</a> of the Chrome downloads experience on desktop to make it easier for users to interact with recent downloads. At the time, we mentioned that the additional space and more flexible UI of the new Chrome downloads experience would give us new opportunities to make sure users stay safe when downloading files. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Adding context and consistency to download warnings</strong>
</p>
<p>
The redesigned Chrome downloads experience gives us the opportunity to provide even more context when Chrome protects a user from a <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6261569">potentially malicious file</a>. Taking advantage of the additional space available in the new downloads UI, we have replaced our previous warning messages with more detailed ones that convey more nuance about the nature of the danger and can help users make more informed decisions.

<em>Our legacy, space-constrained warning vs. our redesigned one</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
We also made download warnings more understandable by introducing a two-tier download warning taxonomy based on AI-powered malware verdicts from <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Google Safe Browsing</a>. These are: 
</p>
<ol>

<li>Suspicious files (lower confidence verdict, unknown risk of user harm)

</li><li>Dangerous files (high confidence verdict, high risk of user harm)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These two tiers of warnings are distinguished by iconography, color, and text, to make it easy for users to quickly and confidently make the best choice for themselves based on the nature of the danger and Safe Browsing's level of certainty. Overall, these improvements in clarity and consistency have resulted in significant changes in user behavior, including fewer warnings bypassed, warnings heeded more quickly, and all in all, better protection from malicious downloads.

<em>Differentiation between suspicious and dangerous warnings</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>Protecting more downloads with automatic deep scans</strong>
</p>
<p>
Users who have opted-in to the <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866">Enhanced Protection</a> mode of Safe Browsing in Chrome are prompted to send the contents of suspicious files to Safe Browsing for deep scanning before opening the file. Suspicious files are a small fraction of overall downloads, and file contents are only scanned for security purposes and are deleted shortly after a verdict is returned.
</p>
<p>
We've found these additional scans to have been extraordinarily successful – they help catch brand new malware that Safe Browsing has not seen before and dangerous files hosted on brand new sites. In fact, <strong>files sent for deep scanning are over 50x more likely to be flagged as malware</strong> than downloads in the aggregate.
</p>
<p>
Since Enhanced Protection users have already agreed to send a small fraction of their downloads to Safe Browsing for security purposes in order to benefit from additional protections, we recently moved towards automatic deep scans for these users rather than prompting each time. This will protect users from risky downloads while reducing user friction.
</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYi1YW6gCA9xGgTp67Z7QVvH6guYbAVN6HUl1XrOxAYHS308MtmpVddM83GMVWa8OUtctfL5HA0gMopBIgw8qNX3OXD6j_8HWKYyfzy0nwhFYxvhiJIsx3W251jg8Jnv2Wx4_X3WuNO5YNnJbxU52ru8maUatuULjEGYBNqR0fuJp181b9Gje9tllPDROo/s1080/Chrome_Auto-Scan-Block_Inline_V1.gif" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYi1YW6gCA9xGgTp67Z7QVvH6guYbAVN6HUl1XrOxAYHS308MtmpVddM83GMVWa8OUtctfL5HA0gMopBIgw8qNX3OXD6j_8HWKYyfzy0nwhFYxvhiJIsx3W251jg8Jnv2Wx4_X3WuNO5YNnJbxU52ru8maUatuULjEGYBNqR0fuJp181b9Gje9tllPDROo/s16000/Chrome_Auto-Scan-Block_Inline_V1.gif" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">
<em>An automatic deep scan resulting in a warning</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>Staying ahead of attackers who hide in encrypted archives</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not all deep scans can be conducted automatically. A current trend in <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/">cookie theft</a> malware distribution is packaging malicious software in an encrypted archive – a .zip, .7z, or .rar file, protected by a password – which hides file contents from Safe Browsing and other antivirus detection scans. In order to combat this evasion technique, we have introduced two protection mechanisms depending on the mode of Safe Browsing selected by the user in Chrome.
</p>
<p>
Attackers often make the passwords to encrypted archives available in places like the page from which the file was downloaded, or in the download file name. For Enhanced Protection users, downloads of suspicious encrypted archives will now prompt the user to enter the file's password and send it along with the file to Safe Browsing so that the file can be opened and a deep scan may be performed. Uploaded files and file passwords are deleted a short time after they're scanned, and all collected data is only used by Safe Browsing to provide better download protections.
</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeWn18o6NDzNv7ILTz4Hv-U-4kH-WUx8goTr_8HavUJIn_f3vW9DKGJYxd0rmElQdxeYFp6bPmHU3XJkGnZUToAsdkSE_i_xjv7d4CEzR-7crVH3z2jLtOynwIeJYXBbddPfas_-rfSS3R-sbAZkpR3zQyCAiBCpXB4xzc7CUuyPkDRPdlx8lCtAIa5m2_/s1080/FilePassword_inline_Option%2003%20(More%20cropped%20in).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeWn18o6NDzNv7ILTz4Hv-U-4kH-WUx8goTr_8HavUJIn_f3vW9DKGJYxd0rmElQdxeYFp6bPmHU3XJkGnZUToAsdkSE_i_xjv7d4CEzR-7crVH3z2jLtOynwIeJYXBbddPfas_-rfSS3R-sbAZkpR3zQyCAiBCpXB4xzc7CUuyPkDRPdlx8lCtAIa5m2_/s16000/FilePassword_inline_Option%2003%20(More%20cropped%20in).png" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Enter a file password to send an encrypted file for a malware scan</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
For those who use Standard Protection mode which is the default in Chrome, we still wanted to be able to provide some level of protection. In Standard Protection mode, downloading a suspicious encrypted archive will also trigger a prompt to enter the file's password, but in this case, both the file and the password stay on the local device and only the metadata of the archive contents are checked with Safe Browsing. As such, in this mode, users are still protected as long as Safe Browsing had previously seen and categorized the malware.
</p>
<p>
The Chrome Security team works closely with Safe Browsing, Google's <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/">Threat Analysis Group</a>, and security researchers from around the world to gain insights into the techniques attackers are using. Using these insights, we are constantly adapting our product strategy to stay ahead of attackers and to keep users safe while downloading files in Chrome. We look forward to sharing more in the future!

<p>
<em><b>Update (07/22/2024): </b>Website operators who will be impacted by the upcoming change in Chrome for new TLS certificates issued after October 31, 2024 can explore continuity options offered by Entrust. Entrust has expressed its commitment to continuing to support customer needs, and is best positioned to describe the available options for website operators. Learn more at Entrust’s <a href="https://www.entrust.com/tls-certificate-information-center">TLS Certificate Information Center</a>.</em>
</p>

    

<p>
The Chrome Security Team prioritizes the security and privacy of Chrome’s users, and we are unwilling to compromise on these values.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/">Chrome Root Program Policy</a> states that CA certificates included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a> must provide value to Chrome end users that exceeds the risk of their continued inclusion. It also describes many of the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/#7-reporting-and-responding-to-incidents">factors</a> we consider significant when CA Owners disclose and respond to incidents. When things don’t go right, we expect CA Owners to commit to meaningful and demonstrable change resulting in evidenced continuous improvement.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past several years, publicly disclosed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?o2=greaterthaneq&amp;short_desc_type=casesubstring&amp;o1=notequals&amp;v1=Graveyard&amp;classification=Client%20Software&amp;classification=Developer%20Infrastructure&amp;classification=Components&amp;classification=Server%20Software&amp;classification=Other&amp;classification=Graveyard&amp;v2=2015-11-01&amp;f1=classification&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED&amp;short_desc=Entrust&amp;f2=creation_ts&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;list_id=17064895">incident reports</a> highlighted a pattern of concerning behaviors by Entrust that fall short of the above expectations, and has eroded confidence in their competence, reliability, and integrity as a publicly-trusted CA Owner. 
</p>
<p>
In response to the above concerns and to preserve the integrity of the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/how-chrome-root-program-keeps-users-safe.html#:~:text=Chrome%20uses%20digital,the%20%E2%80%9CWeb%20PKI.%E2%80%9D">Web PKI</a> ecosystem, Chrome will take the following actions.

<p>
Additionally, should a Chrome user or enterprise <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#Does-the-Chrome-Certificate-Verifier-consider-local-trust-decisions">explicitly trust</a> any of the above certificates on a platform and version of Chrome <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#when-did-these-features-land">relying</a> on the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a> (e.g., explicit trust is conveyed through a Group Policy Object on Windows), the SCT-based constraints described above will be overridden and certificates will function as they do today.  
</p>
<p>
To further minimize risk of disruption, website operators are encouraged to review the “Frequently Asked Questions" listed below.
</p>
<h3><strong>Why is Chrome taking action?</strong></h3>


<p>
Certification Authorities (CAs) serve a privileged and trusted role on the Internet that underpin encrypted connections between browsers and websites. With this tremendous responsibility comes an expectation of adhering to reasonable and consensus-driven security and compliance expectations, including those defined by the CA/Browser TLS Baseline Requirements.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past six years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports. When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the Internet ecosystem, it is our opinion that Chrome’s continued trust in Entrust is no longer justified. 
</p>
<h3><strong>When will this action happen?</strong></h3>


<p>
Blocking action will begin on approximately November 1, 2024, affecting certificates issued at that point or later.
</p>
<p>
Blocking action will occur in Versions of <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule">Chrome 127</a> and greater on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Android, and Linux. Apple policies prevent the Chrome Certificate Verifier and corresponding Chrome Root Store from being used on Chrome for iOS.
</p>
<h3><strong>What is the user impact of this action?</strong></h3>


<p>
By default, Chrome users in the above populations who navigate to a website serving a certificate issued by Entrust or AffirmTrust after October 31, 2024 will see a full page interstitial <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/">similar to this one</a>.
</p>
<p>
Certificates issued by other CAs are not impacted by this action.
</p>
<h3><strong>How can a website operator tell if their website is affected?</strong></h3>


<p>
Website operators can determine if they are affected by this issue by using the Chrome Certificate Viewer.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use the Chrome Certificate Viewer</span>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Navigate to a website (e.g., <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>)

</li><li>Click the “Tune" icon

</li><li>Click “Connection is Secure" 

</li><li>Click “Certificate is Valid" (the Chrome Certificate Viewer will open) 
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Website owner action is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span> contain “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
 
</li><li><strong>Website owner action is required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading contains “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
</ul>
<h3><strong>What does an affected website operator do?</strong></h3>


<p>
We recommend that affected website operators transition to a new publicly-trusted CA Owner as soon as reasonably possible. To avoid adverse website user impact, action <strong>must</strong> be completed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the existing certificate(s) expire if expiry is planned to take place <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> October 31, 2024. 
</p>
<p>
While website operators could delay the impact of blocking action by choosing to collect and install a new TLS certificate issued from Entrust before Chrome’s blocking action begins on November 1, 2024, website operators will inevitably need to collect and install a new TLS certificate from one of the many other CAs included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a>.
</p>
<h3><strong>Can I test these changes before they take effect?</strong></h3>


<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p>
A command-line flag was added beginning in Chrome 128 (available in Canary/Dev at the time of this post’s publication) that allows administrators and power users to simulate the effect of an SCTNotAfter distrust constraint as described in this blog post FAQ.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to: Simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust</span></p><p>1. Close all open versions of Chrome</p><p>2. Start Chrome using the following command-line flag, substituting variables described below with actual values</p>

<div class="code">
--test-crs-constraints=$[Comma Separated List of Trust Anchor Certificate SHA256 Hashes]:sctnotafter=$[epoch_timestamp]
</div><p>

</p><p>3. Evaluate the effects of the flag with test websites&nbsp;</p><p><b>Example:</b>&nbsp;The following command will simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust with an effective date of April 30, 2024 11:59:59 PM GMT for all of the Entrust trust anchors included in the Chrome Root Store.

</p><h3><strong>I use Entrust certificates for my internal enterprise network, do I need to do anything?</strong></h3><p>
Beginning in Chrome 127, enterprises can override Chrome Root Store constraints like those described for Entrust in this blog post by installing the corresponding root CA certificate as a <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#Does-the-Chrome-Certificate-Verifier-consider-local-trust-decisions">locally-trusted root</a> on the platform Chrome is running (e.g., installed in the Microsoft Certificate Store as a Trusted Root CA).
</p><h3><strong>How do enterprises add a CA as locally-trusted?</strong></h3><p>
Customer organizations should defer to platform provider guidance.

To this end we are excited to announce the launch of kvmCTF, a vulnerability reward program (VRP) for the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor first announced in</span><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/expanding-our-exploit-reward-program-to.html"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="color: black; font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> October</span></a><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> 2023.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">KVM is a robust hypervisor with over 15 years of open-source development and is widely used throughout the consumer and enterprise landscape, including platforms such as Android and Google Cloud. Google is an active contributor to the project and we designed kvmCTF as a collaborative way to help identify &amp; remediate vulnerabilities and further harden this fundamental security boundary.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Similar to </span><a href="https://google.github.io/security-research/kernelctf/rules"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">kernelCTF</span></a><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">, kvmCTF is a vulnerability reward program designed to help identify and address vulnerabilities in the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It offers a lab environment where participants can log in and utilize their exploits to obtain flags. Significantly, in kvmCTF the focus is on zero day vulnerabilities and as a result, we will not be rewarding exploits that use n-days vulnerabilities. Details regarding the&nbsp; zero day vulnerability will be shared with Google after an upstream patch is released to ensure that Google obtains them at the same time as the rest of the open-source community.&nbsp; Additionally, kvmCTF uses the Google </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/bare-metal?hl=en"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Bare Metal Solution</span></a><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> (BMS) environment to host its infrastructure. Finally, given how critical a hypervisor is to overall system security, kvmCTF will reward various levels of vulnerabilities up to and including code execution and VM escape.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">How it works</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The environment consists of a bare metal host running a single guest VM. Participants will be able to reserve time slots to access the guest VM and attempt to perform a guest-to-host attack. The goal of the attack must be to exploit a zero day vulnerability in the KVM subsystem of the host kernel. If successful, the attacker will obtain a flag that proves their accomplishment in exploiting the vulnerability. The severity of the attack will determine the reward amount, which will be based on the reward tier system explained below. All reports will be thoroughly evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The rewards tiers are the following:</span></p><ul style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Full VM escape: $250,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Arbitrary memory write: $100,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Arbitrary memory read: $50,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Relative memory write: $50,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Denial of service: $20,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Relative memory read: $10,000</span></p></li></ul><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">To facilitate the relative memory write/read tiers and partly the denial of service, kvmCTF offers the option of using a host with KASAN enabled.

<title>Staying Safe with Chrome Extensions</title>

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Benjamin Ackerman, Anunoy Ghosh and David Warren, Chrome Security Team </span>


    



<p>
Chrome extensions can boost your browsing, empowering you to do anything from customizing the look of sites to providing personalized advice when you’re planning a vacation. But as with any software, extensions can also introduce risk. 
</p>
<p>
That’s why we have a team whose only job is to focus on keeping you safe as you install and take advantage of Chrome extensions. Our team:<br />
</p>
<ul>

<li>Provides you with a personalized summary of the extensions you’ve installed

</li><li>Reviews extensions before they’re published on the Chrome Web Store

</li><li>Continuously monitors extensions after they’re published
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A summary of your extensions</h3>


<p>
The top of the extensions page (chrome://extensions) warns you of any extensions you have installed that might pose a security risk. (If you don’t see a warning panel, you probably don’t have any extensions you need to worry about.) The panel includes:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Extensions suspected of including malware

</li><li>Extensions that violate Chrome Web Store policies

</li><li>Extensions that have been unpublished by a developer, which might indicate that an extension is no longer supported

</li><li>Extensions that aren’t from the <a href="chromewebstore.google.com/">Chrome Web Store</a>

</li><li>Extensions that haven’t published what they do with data they collect and other privacy practices  
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You’ll get notified when Chrome’s Safety Check has recommendations for you or you can check on your own by running Safety Check. Just type “run safety check” in Chrome’s address bar and select the corresponding shortcut: “Go to Chrome safety check.”</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGnX_FKYFwb8VZZcQnZ3-XBpz2N_7yicx-E6FYd0gPL2-WtKiKStwT6-9h-i6y-wlxaFuCriKKNceyRJxSIBkP4V2b0-rk-TK0C9XNxivbsUmpJe3o7TCrlAlKS2eO39XDVePBHjwjI9AqOnCcs-X7qiiFL3wfozInqP5FxGs4dykCva0QObfrWxAqd2g5/s1920/PS_Extension-Review-Panel_V3.gif" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGnX_FKYFwb8VZZcQnZ3-XBpz2N_7yicx-E6FYd0gPL2-WtKiKStwT6-9h-i6y-wlxaFuCriKKNceyRJxSIBkP4V2b0-rk-TK0C9XNxivbsUmpJe3o7TCrlAlKS2eO39XDVePBHjwjI9AqOnCcs-X7qiiFL3wfozInqP5FxGs4dykCva0QObfrWxAqd2g5/s16000/PS_Extension-Review-Panel_V3.gif" /></a></div>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<em>User flow of removing extensions highlighted by Safety Check.</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Besides the Safety Check, you can visit the extensions page directly in a number of ways:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Navigate to chrome://extensions

</li><li>Click the puzzle icon and choose “Manage extensions”

</li><li>Click the More choices menu and choose menu &gt; Extensions &gt; Manage Extensions
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Reviewing extensions before they’re published</h3>


<p>
Before an extension is even accessible to install from the Chrome Web Store, we have two levels of verification to ensure an extension is safe:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>An automated review</strong>: Each extension gets examined by our machine-learning systems to spot possible violations or suspicious behavior.

</li><li><strong>A human review</strong>: Next, a team member examines the images, descriptions, and public policies of each extension. Depending on the results of both the automated and manual review, we may perform an even deeper and more thorough review of the code. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This review process weeds out the overwhelming majority of bad extensions before they even get published. In 2024, less than 1% of all installs from the Chrome Web Store were found to include malware. We're proud of this record and yet some bad extensions still get through, which is why we also monitor published extensions.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Monitoring published extensions</h3>


<p>
The same Chrome team that reviews extensions before they get published also reviews extensions that are already on the Chrome Web Store. And just like the pre-check, this monitoring includes both human and machine reviews. We also work closely with trusted security researchers outside of Google, and even pay researchers who report possible threats to Chrome users through our <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5878023369523200/developer-data-protection-reward-program-rules#chrome-extensions">Developer Data Protection Rewards Program</a>.
</p>
<p>
What about extensions that get updated over time, or are programmed to execute malicious code at a later date? Our systems monitor for that as well, by periodically reviewing what extensions are actually doing and comparing that to the stated objectives defined by each extension in the Chrome Web Store.
</p>
<p>
If the team finds that an extension poses a severe risk to Chrome users, it’s immediately remove from the Chrome Web Store and the extension gets disabled on all browsers that have it installed.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5EZOqvRh5BCBErZ6qEN2pXYDPjbCUXL8VmMKCXo-Hz57cfx9yMD97oCmoZ2qpHOGM-3rAPkoStj458SJLdFSz2lNKq6ggIsbb31Paa2uEK_j1YsHlJVnk0wWkRRxQpYjAKWHkldOktUBtVLLogyHg40TTt4SdqY4aQFit9PhYdDT6RJrgwrW0xN5vNeZg/s2000/Chrome_Privacy-Sandbox_Extensions-Safety-Blog-In-line-Asset-1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5EZOqvRh5BCBErZ6qEN2pXYDPjbCUXL8VmMKCXo-Hz57cfx9yMD97oCmoZ2qpHOGM-3rAPkoStj458SJLdFSz2lNKq6ggIsbb31Paa2uEK_j1YsHlJVnk0wWkRRxQpYjAKWHkldOktUBtVLLogyHg40TTt4SdqY4aQFit9PhYdDT6RJrgwrW0xN5vNeZg/s16000/Chrome_Privacy-Sandbox_Extensions-Safety-Blog-In-line-Asset-1.png" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>The extensions page highlights when you have a potentially unsafe extension downloaded</i></p>



<div class="code">
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Others steps you can take to stay safe</h3><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">Review new extensions before installing them</h2>


<p>
The Chrome Web Store provides useful information about each extension and its developer. The following information should help you decide whether it’s safe to install an extension: 
</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/find-great-extensions-new-chrome-web-store-badges/">Verified and featured badges</a> are awarded by the Chrome team to extensions that follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design

</li><li>Ratings and reviews from our users

</li><li>Information about the developer

</li><li>Privacy practices, including information about how an extension handles your data
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Be careful of sites that try to quickly persuade you to install extensions, especially if the site has little in common with the extension.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Review extensions you’ve already installed</h2>


<p>
Even though Safety Check and your Extensions page (chrome://extensions) warn you of extensions that might pose a risk, it’s still a good idea to review your extensions from time to time. 
</p>
<ol>

<li>Uninstall extensions that you no longer use.

</li><li>Review the description of an extension in the Chrome Web Store, considering the extension’s ratings, reviews, and privacy practices — reviews can change over time.

</li><li>Compare an extension’s stated goals with 1) the permissions requested by an extension and 2) the privacy practices published by the extension. If requested permissions don’t align with stated goals, consider uninstalling the extension.

</li><li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en">Limit the sites</a> an extension has permission to work on. 
</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Enable Enhanced Protection</h2>


<p>
The Enhanced protection mode of Safe Browsing is Chrome’s <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/enhanced-protection-strongest-level-of.html">highest level of protection</a> that we offer. Not only does this mode provide you with the best protections against phishing and malware, but it also provides additional features targeted to keep you safe against potentially harmful extensions. Threats are constantly evolving and Safe Browsing’s Enhanced protection mode is the best way to ensure that you have the most advanced security features in Chrome. This can be enabled from the Safe Browsing settings page in Chrome (chrome://settings/security) and selecting “Enhanced”.

Among the experts, one initial focus was on “Fire Evacuation Tests”. The earliest of these tests focused on individual performance and tested occupants on their evacuation speed, sometimes performing the tests “by surprise” as though the fire drill were a real fire. These early tests were more likely to result in injuries to the test-takers than any improvement in survivability. It wasn’t until introducing better protective engineering - wider doors, push bars at exits, firebreaks in construction, lighted exit signs, and so on - that survival rates from building fires began to improve. As protections evolved over the years and improvements like mandatory fire sprinklers became required in building code, survival rates </span><a href="https://www.nfpa.org/education-and-research/research/nfpa-research/fire-statistical-reports/fire-loss-in-the-united-states"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">have continued to improve steadily</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">, and “tests” have evolved into announced, advanced training and posted evacuation plans.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">In this blog, we will analyze the modern practice of Phishing “Tests” as a cybersecurity control as it relates to industry-standard fire protection practices.</span></p><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #434343; font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></h3><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #434343; font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">Modern “Phishing tests” strongly resemble the early “Fire tests”</span></h3><div><br /></div><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Roboto, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Google currently operates under regulations (for example, FedRAMP in the USA) that require us to perform annual “Phishing Tests.” In these mandatory tests, the Security team creates and sends phishing emails to Googlers, counts how many interact with the email, and educates them on how to “not be fooled” by phishing. These exercises typically collect reporting metrics on sent emails and how many employees “failed” by clicking the decoy link. Usually, further education is required for employees who fail the exercise.

As long as humans are fallible and social creatures, attackers will have ways to manipulate the human factor. The more effective approach to both risks is a focused pursuit of secure-by-default systems in the long term, and a focus on investment in engineering defenses such as unphishable credentials (like </span><a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/passkeys-default-google-accounts/"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">passkeys)</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> and implementing multi-party approval for sensitive security contexts throughout production systems. It’s because of investments in architectural defenses like these that Google hasn’t had to seriously worry about password phishing in nearly a decade.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Educating employees about alerting security teams of attacks in progress remains a valuable and essential addition to a holistic security posture. However, there’s no need to make this adversarial, and we don’t gain anything by “catching” people “failing” at the task. Let's stop engaging in the same old failed protections and follow the lead of more mature industries, such as Fire Protection, which has faced these problems before and already settled on a balanced approach.&nbsp;</span></p></span></div>

<title>I/O 2024: What’s new in Android security and privacy</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/05/io-2024-whats-new-in-android-security.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/05/io-2024-whats-new-in-android-security.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Dave Kleidermacher, VP Engineering, Android Security and Privacy</span>


<p>
Our commitment to user safety is a top priority for Android. We’ve been consistently working to stay ahead of the world’s scammers, fraudsters and bad actors. And as their tactics evolve in sophistication and scale, we continually adapt and enhance our advanced security features and AI-powered protections to help keep Android users safe. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to our new suite of advanced <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-theft-protection">theft protection features</a> to help keep your device and data safe in the case of theft, we’re also focusing increasingly on providing additional protections against mobile financial fraud and scams. <br />
</p>
<p>
Today, we’re announcing more new fraud and scam protection features coming in Android 15 and Google Play services updates later this year to help better protect users around the world. We’re also sharing new tools and policies to help developers build safer apps and keep their users safe.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Google Play Protect live threat detection</strong>
</p>
<p>
Google Play Protect now scans 200 billion Android apps daily, helping keep more than 3 billion users safe from malware. We are expanding Play Protect’s on-device AI capabilities with Google Play Protect live threat detection to improve fraud and abuse detection against apps that try to cloak their actions. 
</p>
<p>
With live threat detection, Google Play Protect’s on-device AI will analyze additional behavioral signals related to the use of sensitive permissions and interactions with other apps and services. If suspicious behavior is discovered, Google Play Protect can send the app to Google for additional review and then warn users or disable the app if malicious behavior is confirmed. The detection of suspicious behavior is done on device in a privacy preserving way through Private Compute Core, which allows us to <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/trust-in-transparency-private-compute.html">protect users without collecting data</a>. Google Pixel, Honor, Lenovo, Nothing, OnePlus, Oppo, Sharp, Transsion, and other manufacturers are deploying live threat detection later this year. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Stronger protections against fraud and scams </strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re also bringing additional protections to fight fraud and scams in Android 15 with two key enhancements to safeguard your information and privacy from bad apps:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Protecting One-time Passwords from Malware:</strong> With the exception of a few types of apps, such as wearable companion apps, one-time passwords are now hidden from notifications, closing a common attack vector for fraud and spyware. 

<li><strong>Expanded Restricted Settings</strong>: To help protect more sensitive permissions that are commonly abused by fraudsters, we’re expanding Android 13’s <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/12623953?hl=en">restricted settings</a>, which require additional user approval to enable permissions when installing an app from an Internet-sideloading source (web browsers, messaging apps or file managers).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We are continuing to develop new, AI-powered protections, like the <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024">scam call detection capability</a> that we’re testing, which uses on-device Gemini-Nano AI to warn users in real-time when it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with fraud and scams. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Protecting against screen-sharing social engineering attacks<br /></strong><br />We’re also tightening controls for screen sharing in Android 15 to limit social engineering attacks that try to view your screen and steal information, while introducing new safeguards to further shield your sensitive information: 
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Automatically Hidden Notifications and One-time Passwords (OTPs):</strong> During screen sharing, private notification content will be hidden, preventing remote viewers from seeing details in a user's notifications. Apps that post OTPs in notifications will be automatically protected from remote viewers when you’re screen sharing, helping thwart attempts to steal sensitive data. 

<li><strong>Safer Logins: </strong>Your screen will be hidden when you enter credentials like usernames, passwords and credit card numbers during a screen-share session.

<li><strong>Choose What You Share:</strong> Currently available on Pixel, other Android devices will also have the ability to share just one app's content rather than your whole screen to help preserve your screen privacy.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Having clear content sharing indicators is important for users to understand when their data is visible. A new, more prominent screen indicator coming to Android devices later this year will always let you know when screen sharing is active, and you can stop sharing with a simple tap. 
</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF9sSXpP5qJ8i6XEv7mky1cmZhVsDEhzku1rovY4GDAsJS7wx5BmxrHKzaE496UMlUYEklG7BBtz331up3hhCvV5h-2jSHUbUiqHrsxqW8nh-62dxTydtJpqK_i-CX3YoQWDSfuL-l3t_B_ILflRaEPhytzFcF-7OaQJOkFJzpW55rwjIXJwkGs6IDgt-j/s3816/Hide%20notifications%20and%20OTPs.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF9sSXpP5qJ8i6XEv7mky1cmZhVsDEhzku1rovY4GDAsJS7wx5BmxrHKzaE496UMlUYEklG7BBtz331up3hhCvV5h-2jSHUbUiqHrsxqW8nh-62dxTydtJpqK_i-CX3YoQWDSfuL-l3t_B_ILflRaEPhytzFcF-7OaQJOkFJzpW55rwjIXJwkGs6IDgt-j/s400/Hide%20notifications%20and%20OTPs.png" /></a></div>
<p>
<strong>Advanced cellular security to fight fraud and surveillance<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re adding new advanced cellular protections in Android 15 to defend against abuse by criminals using cell site simulators to snoop on users or send them SMS-based fraud messages. 
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Cellular Cipher Transparency: </strong>We’ll notify you if your cellular network connection is unencrypted, potentially exposing voice and SMS traffic to radio interception, and potentially visible to others. This can help warn users if they’re being targeted by criminals who are trying to intercept their traffic or inject a fraud SMS message.

<li><strong>Identifier Disclosure Transparency: </strong>We’ll help at risk-users like journalists or dissidents by alerting them if a potential false cellular base station or surveillance tool is recording their location using a device identifier.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These features require device OEM integration and compatible hardware. We are working with the Android ecosystem to bring these features to users. We expect OEM adoption to progress over the next couple of years. 
</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhvuLLtMUwGfLTp4gmw6f_2_UuhR3KmVAm-2tlwHexRs8qNlntBWGXo9bwggAONKocQXVqB09MoIATqqwwjmpUG5QtgGfgFz-Lc7nVdLgvf3vGPCNN1UlJoF72Bzfy0_-UwfMON2FbMUfPq75ABmlc8JER42jl3xL46J4Xc3kOkArWgDvvSBkn3tqJ5Uv4/s3816/Cellular%20security%20encryption%20warning%20blog.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhvuLLtMUwGfLTp4gmw6f_2_UuhR3KmVAm-2tlwHexRs8qNlntBWGXo9bwggAONKocQXVqB09MoIATqqwwjmpUG5QtgGfgFz-Lc7nVdLgvf3vGPCNN1UlJoF72Bzfy0_-UwfMON2FbMUfPq75ABmlc8JER42jl3xL46J4Xc3kOkArWgDvvSBkn3tqJ5Uv4/s400/Cellular%20security%20encryption%20warning%20blog.png" /></a></div>
<p>
<strong>More security tools for developers to fight fraud and scams</strong>
</p>
<p>
Safeguarding apps from scams and fraud is an ongoing battle for developers. The <a href="g.co/play/integrityapi">Play Integrity API</a> lets developers check that their apps are unmodified and running on a genuine Android device so that they can detect fraudulent or risky behavior and take actions to prevent attacks and abuse. We’ve updated the API with new in-app signals to help developers secure their apps against new threats: <br />
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Risk From Screen Capturing or Remote Access:</strong> Developers can check if there are other apps running that could be capturing the screen, creating overlays, or controlling the device. This is helpful for apps that want to hide sensitive information from other apps and protect users from scams. 

<li><strong>Risk From Known Malware:</strong> Developers can check if Google Play Protect is active and the user device is free of known malware before performing sensitive actions or handling sensitive data. This is particularly valuable for financial and banking apps, adding another layer of security to protect user information.

<li><strong>Risk From Anomalous Devices: </strong>Developers can also opt-in to receive recent device activity to check if a device is making too many integrity checks, which could be a sign of an attack. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Developers can decide how their apps respond to these signals, such as prompting the user to close risky apps or turn on Google Play Protect before continuing. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Upgraded policies and tools for developers to enhance user privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re working to make photo permissions even more private for users. Starting this year<strong>, </strong>apps on Play must demonstrate that they require broad access to use the photo or video permissions. Google Play will start enforcing this policy in August. We’ve updated photo picker, Android’s preferred solution for granting individual access to photos and videos without requiring broad permissions. Photo picker now includes support for cloud storage services like Google Photos. It’s much easier to find the right photo by browsing albums and favorites. Coming later this year, photo picker will support local and cloud search as well.<br /><br /><strong>Always evolving our multi-layered protections</strong>
</p>
<p>
Android's commitment to user safety is unwavering. We're constantly evolving our multi-layered user protections – combining the power of advanced AI with close partnerships across OEMs, the Android ecosystem, and the security research community. Building a truly secure Android experience is a collaborative effort, and we'll continue to work tirelessly to safeguard your device and data.

<p>
Google and Apple have worked together to create an industry specification – <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/">Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers</a> – for Bluetooth tracking devices that makes it possible to alert users across both Android and iOS if such a device is unknowingly being used to track them. This will help mitigate the misuse of devices designed to help keep track of belongings. Google is now launching this capability on Android 6.0+ devices, and today Apple is implementing this capability in iOS 17.5.<br />
</p>
<p>
With this new capability, Android users will now get a “Tracker traveling with you” alert on their device if an unknown Bluetooth tracking device is seen moving with them over time, regardless of the platform the device is paired with. 
</p>
<p>
If a user gets such an alert on their Android device, it means that someone else’s AirTag, Find My Device network-compatible tracker tag, or other industry specification-compatible Bluetooth tracker is moving with them. Android users can view the tracker’s identifier, have the tracker play a sound to help locate it, and access instructions to disable it. Bluetooth tag manufacturers including Chipolo, eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee have committed that future tags will be compatible.
</p>
<p>
Google’s Find My Device is secure by default and private by design. <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-network-security-privacy-protections.html">Multi-layered user protections</a>, including first of its kind safety-first protections, help mitigate potential risks to user privacy and safety while allowing users to effectively locate and recover lost devices. This cross-platform collaboration — an industry first, involving community and industry input — offers instructions and best practices for manufacturers, should they choose to build unwanted tracking alert capabilities into their products. Google and Apple will continue to work with the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> via the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers working group to develop the official standard for this technology.

Passkeys are a new industry standard that give users an easy, highly secure way to sign-in to apps and websites. Today, we announced that passkeys have been used to authenticate users more than 1 billion times across over 400 million Google Accounts.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">As more users encounter passkeys, we’re often asked questions about how they relate to security keys, how Google Workspace administrators can configure passkeys for the user accounts that they manage, and how they relate to the Advanced Protection Program (APP). This post will seek to clarify these topics.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Passkeys and security keys</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Passkeys are an evolution of security keys, meaning users get the same security benefits, but with a much simplified experience. Passkeys can be used in the Google Account sign-in process in many of the same ways that security keys have been used in the past — in fact, you can now </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;">choose </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">to store your passkey on your security key. This provides users with three key benefits:</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Stronger security</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">. Users typically authenticate with passkeys by entering their device’s screen lock PIN, or using a biometric authentication method, like a fingerprint or a face scan. By storing the passkey on a security key, users can ensure that passkeys are only available when the security key is plugged into their device, creating a stronger security posture.</span></p></li></ul><br /><ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Flexible portability</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">. Today, users rely on password managers to make passkeys available across all of their devices. Security keys provide an alternate way to use your passkeys across your devices: by bringing your security keys with you.</span></p></li></ul><br /><ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Simpler sign-in.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;"> Passkeys can act as a first- and second-factor, simultaneously.

<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Chromium's sandboxed process model defends well from malicious web content, but there are limits to how well the application can protect itself from malware already on the computer. Cookies and other credentials remain a high value target for attackers, and we are trying to tackle this ongoing threat in multiple ways, including working on web standards like
  <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/04/fighting-cookie-theft-using-device.html" target="_blank">DBSC</a>
  that will help disrupt the cookie theft industry since exfiltrating these cookies will no longer have any value.</p>
<p>Where it is not possible to prevent the theft of credentials and cookies by malware, the next best thing is making the attack more observable by antivirus, endpoint detection agents, or enterprise administrators with basic log analysis tools.</p>
<p>This blog describes one set of signals for use by system administrators or endpoint detection agents that should reliably flag any access to the browser’s protected data from another application on the system. By increasing the likelihood of an attack being detected, this changes the calculus for those attackers who might have a strong desire to remain stealthy, and might cause them to rethink carrying out these types of attacks against our users.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Chromium based browsers on Windows use the DPAPI (Data Protection API) to secure local secrets such as cookies, password etc. against theft. DPAPI protection is based on a key derived from the user's login credential and is designed to protect against unauthorized access to secrets from other users on the system, or when the system is powered off. Because the DPAPI secret is bound to the logged in user, it cannot protect against local malware attacks — malware executing as the user or at a higher privilege level can just call the same APIs as the browser to obtain the DPAPI secret.</p>
<p>Since 2013, Chromium has been applying the CRYPTPROTECT_AUDIT flag to DPAPI calls to request that an audit log be generated when decryption occurs, as well as tagging the data as being owned by the browser. Because all of Chromium's encrypted data storage is backed by a DPAPI-secured key, any application that wishes to decrypt this data, including malware, should always reliably generate a clearly observable event log, which can be used to detect these types of attacks.</p>
<p>There are three main steps involved in taking advantage of this log:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enable logging on the computer running Google Chrome, or any other Chromium based browser.</li>
  <li>Export the event logs to your backend system.</li>
  <li>Create detection logic to detect theft.</li>
</ol>
<p>This blog will also show how the logging works in practice by testing it against a python password stealer.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Step 1: Enable logging on the system</strong>
</p>
<p>DPAPI events are logged into two places in the system. Firstly, there is the
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4693" target="_blank">4693</a> event that can be logged into the Security Log. This event can be enabled by turning on "Audit DPAPI Activity" and the steps to do this are described
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-dpapi-activity" target="_blank">here</a>, the policy itself sits deep within Security Settings -&gt; Advanced Audit Policy Configuration -&gt; Detailed Tracking.</p>
<p>Here is what the 4693 event looks like:</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Provider Name&amp;equals&quot;Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing&quot; Guid&amp;equals&quot;&amp;lcub&amp;period&amp;period&amp;period&amp;rcub&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;4693&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Version&gt;0&lt;&amp;solVersion&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Level&gt;0&lt;&amp;solLevel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Task&gt;13314&lt;&amp;solTask&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Opcode&gt;0&lt;&amp;solOpcode&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Keywords&gt;0x8020000000000000&lt;&amp;solKeywords&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2015-08-22T06&amp;colon25&amp;colon14&amp;period589407700Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventRecordID&gt;175809&lt;&amp;solEventRecordID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Correlation &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Execution ProcessID&amp;equals&quot;520&quot; ThreadID&amp;equals&quot;1340&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Channel&gt;Security&lt;&amp;solChannel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Computer&gt;DC01&amp;periodcontoso&amp;periodlocal&lt;&amp;solComputer&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Security &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectUserSid&quot;&gt;S-1-5-21-3457937927-2839227994-823803824-1104&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectUserName&quot;&gt;dadmin&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectDomainName&quot;&gt;CONTOSO&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectLogonId&quot;&gt;0x30d7c&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;MasterKeyId&quot;&gt;0445c766-75f0-4de7-82ad-d9d97aad59f6&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;RecoveryReason&quot;&gt;0x5c005c&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;RecoveryServer&quot;&gt;DC01&amp;periodcontoso&amp;periodlocal&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;RecoveryKeyId&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;FailureId&quot;&gt;0x380000&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;
</div>
<p>The issue with the 4693 event is that while it is generated if there is DPAPI activity on the system, it unfortunately does not contain information about which process was performing the DPAPI activity, nor does it contain information about which particular secret is being accessed. This is because the
  <strong>Execution ProcessID</strong>
  field in the event will always be the process id of lsass.exe because it is this process that manages the encryption keys for the system, and there is no entry for the description of the data.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that, in recent versions of Windows a new event type was added to help identify the process making the DPAPI call directly. This event was added to the
  <strong>Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI</strong>
  stream which manifests in the Event Log in the Applications and Services Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Crypto-DPAPI part of the Event Viewer tree.</p>
<p>The new event is called
  <strong>DPAPIDefInformationEvent</strong>
  and has id 16385, but unfortunately is only emitted to the Debug channel and by default this is not persisted to an Event Log, unless Debug channel logging is enabled. This can be accomplished by enabling it directly in powershell:</p>
<div class="code">
&amp;dollarlog &amp;equals &amp;grave&amp;NewLine   New-Object System&amp;periodDiagnostics&amp;periodEventing&amp;periodReader&amp;periodEventLogConfiguration &amp;grave&amp;NewLine   Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI&amp;solDebug&amp;NewLine&amp;dollarlog&amp;periodIsEnabled &amp;equals &amp;dollarTrue&amp;NewLine&amp;dollarlog&amp;periodSaveChanges&amp;lpar&amp;rpar&amp;NewLine
</div>
<p>Once this log is enabled then you should start to see 16385 events generated, and these will contain the real process ids of applications performing DPAPI operations. Note that 16385 events are emitted by the operating system even for data not flagged with CRYPTPROTECT_AUDIT, but to identify the data as owned by the browser, the data description is essential. 16385 events are described later.</p>
<p>You will also want to enable
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-process-creation" target="_blank">Audit Process Creation</a> in order to be able to know a current mapping of process ids to process names — more details on that later. You might want to also consider enabling logging of
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/component-updates/command-line-process-auditing" target="_blank">full command lines</a>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Step 2: Collect the events</strong>
</p>
<p>The events you want to collect are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From Security log:</li><p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4688" target="_blank">4688</a>: "A new process was created."
  </li>
</ul>
  <p></p><li>From Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI/Debug log: (enabled above)</li><p></p>
<ul>
  <li>16385: "DPAPIDefInformationEvent"</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>These should be collected from all workstations, and persisted into your enterprise logging system for analysis.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Step 3: Write detection logic to detect theft.</strong>
</p>
<p>With these two events is it now possible to detect when an unauthorized application calls into DPAPI to try and decrypt browser secrets.</p>
<p>The general approach is to generate a map of process ids to active processes using the 4688 events, then every time a 16385 event is generated, it is possible to identify the currently running process, and alert if the process does not match an authorized application such as Google Chrome. You might find your enterprise logging software can already keep track of which process ids map to which process names, so feel free to just use that existing functionality.</p>
<p>Let's dive deeper into the events.</p>
<p>A 4688 event looks like this - e.g. here is Chrome browser launching from explorer:</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Provider Name&amp;equals&quot;Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing&quot; Guid&amp;equals&quot;&amp;lcub...&amp;rcub&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;4688&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Version&gt;2&lt;&amp;solVersion&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Level&gt;0&lt;&amp;solLevel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Task&gt;13312&lt;&amp;solTask&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Opcode&gt;0&lt;&amp;solOpcode&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Keywords&gt;0x8020000000000000&lt;&amp;solKeywords&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2024-03-28T20&amp;colon06&amp;colon41&amp;period9254105Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventRecordID&gt;78258343&lt;&amp;solEventRecordID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Correlation &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Execution ProcessID&amp;equals&quot;4&quot; ThreadID&amp;equals&quot;54256&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Channel&gt;Security&lt;&amp;solChannel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Computer&gt;WIN-GG82ULGC9GO&amp;periodcontoso&amp;periodlocal&lt;&amp;solComputer&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Security &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectUserSid&quot;&gt;S-1-5-18&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectUserName&quot;&gt;WIN-GG82ULGC9GO&amp;dollar&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectDomainName&quot;&gt;CONTOSO&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectLogonId&quot;&gt;0xe8c85cc&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;<span class="highlight">NewProcessId</span>&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">0x17eac</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;NewProcessName&quot;&gt;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolProgram Files&amp;bsolGoogle&amp;bsolChrome&amp;bsolApplication&amp;bsolchrome&amp;periodexe&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TokenElevationType&quot;&gt;&amp;percnt&amp;percnt1938&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ProcessId&quot;&gt;0x16d8&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CommandLine&quot;&gt;&quot;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolProgram Files&amp;bsolGoogle&amp;bsolChrome&amp;bsolApplication&amp;bsolchrome&amp;periodexe&quot; &lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TargetUserSid&quot;&gt;S-1-0-0&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TargetUserName&quot;&gt;-&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TargetDomainName&quot;&gt;-&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TargetLogonId&quot;&gt;0x0&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ParentProcessName&quot;&gt;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolWindows&amp;bsolexplorer&amp;periodexe&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;MandatoryLabel&quot;&gt;S-1-16-8192&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;&amp;NewLine
</div>
<p>The important part here is the
  <strong>NewProcessId</strong>, in hex
  <strong>0x17eac
  </strong>which is
  <strong>97964</strong>.</p>
<p>A 16385 event looks like this:</p>

<p>Each Chromium based browser will tag its data with the product name, e.g. Google Chrome, or Microsoft Edge depending on the owner of the data. This will always appear in the
  <strong>DataDescription
  </strong>field, so it is possible to distinguish browser data from other DPAPI secured data.</p>
<p>Finally, the
  <strong>CallerProcessID
  </strong>will map to the process performing the decryption. In this case, it is 97964 which matches the process ID seen in the 4688 event above, showing that this was likely Google Chrome decrypting its own data! Bear in mind that since these logs only contain the path to the executable, for a full assurance that this is actually Chrome (and not malware pretending to be Chrome, or malware injecting into Chrome), additional protections such as removing administrator access, and application allowlisting could also be used to give a higher assurance of this signal. In recent versions of Chrome or Edge, you might also see logs of decryptions happening in the elevation_service.exe process, which is another legitimate part of the browser's data storage.</p>
<p>To detect unauthorized DPAPI access, you will want to generate a running map of all processes using 4688 events, then look for 16385 events that have a CallerProcessID that does not match a valid caller – Let's try that now.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Testing with a python password stealer</strong>
</p>
<p>We can test that this works with a public script to decrypt passwords taken from
  <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-extract-chrome-passwords-in-python/" target="_blank">a public blog</a>. It generates two events, as expected:</p>
<p>Here is the 16385 event, showing that a process is decrypting the "Google Chrome" key.</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;16385&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2024-03-28T20&amp;colon28&amp;colon13&amp;period7891561Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;OperationType&quot;&gt;SPCryptUnprotect&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;DataDescription&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">Google Chrome</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CallerProcessID&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">68768</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CallerProcessCreationTime&quot;&gt;133561312936527018&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;PlainTextDataSize&quot;&gt;32&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;
</div>
<p>Since the data description being decrypted was "Google Chrome" we know this is an attempt to read Chrome secrets, but to determine the process behind 68768 (0x10ca0), we need to correlate this with a 4688 event.</p>
<p>Here is the corresponding 4688 event from the Security Log (a process start for python3.exe) with the matching process id:</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;4688&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2024-03-28T20&amp;colon28&amp;colon13&amp;period6527871Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;NewProcessId&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">0x10ca0</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;NewProcessName&quot;&gt;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolpython3&amp;bsolbin&amp;bsolpython3&amp;periodexe&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TokenElevationType&quot;&gt;&amp;percnt&amp;percnt1938&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ProcessId&quot;&gt;0xca58&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CommandLine&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">&quot;c&amp;colon&amp;bsolpython3&amp;bsolbin&amp;bsolpython3&amp;periodexe&quot; steal&amp;lowbarpasswords&amp;periodpy</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ParentProcessName&quot;&gt;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolWindows&amp;bsolSystem32&amp;bsolcmd&amp;periodexe&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;
</div>
<p>In this case, the process id matches the python3 executable running a potentially malicious script, so we know this is likely very suspicious behavior, and should trigger an alert immediately! Bear in mind process ids on Windows are not unique so you will want to make sure you use the 4688 event with the timestamp closest, but earlier than, the 16385 event.</p>

<title>How we fought bad apps and bad actors in 2023</title>

<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/how-we-fought-bad-apps-and-bad-actors-in-2023.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Steve Kafka and Khawaja Shams (Android Security and Privacy Team), and Mohet Saxena (Play Trust and Safety)</span>

<p>
A safe and trusted Google Play experience is our top priority. We leverage our SAFE (see below) principles to provide the framework to create that experience for both users and developers. Here's what these principles mean in practice:<br />
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>(S)afeguard our Users</strong>. Help them discover quality apps that they can trust.

<li><strong>(A)dvocate for Developer Protection. </strong>Build platform safeguards to enable developers to focus on growth.

<li><strong>(F)oster Responsible Innovation. </strong>Thoughtfully unlock value for all without compromising on user safety.

<li><strong>(E)volve Platform Defenses. </strong>Stay ahead of emerging threats by evolving our policies, tools and technology.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With those principles in mind, we’ve made recent improvements and introduced new measures to continue to keep Google Play’s users safe, even as the threat landscape continues to evolve. In 2023, we prevented 2.28 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in part thanks to our investment in new and improved security features, policy updates, and advanced machine learning and app review processes. We have also strengthened our developer onboarding and review processes, <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-verify-your-developer-identity-information">requiring more identity information</a> when developers first establish their Play accounts. Together with investments in our review tooling and processes, we identified bad actors and fraud rings more effectively and banned 333K bad accounts from Play for violations like confirmed malware and repeated severe policy violations. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, almost 200K app submissions were rejected or remediated to ensure proper use of sensitive permissions such as background location or SMS access. To help safeguard user privacy at scale, we partnered with SDK providers to limit sensitive data access and sharing, enhancing the privacy posture for over 31 SDKs impacting 790K+ apps. We also significantly expanded the <a href="https://play.google.com/sdks">Google Play SDK Index</a>, which now covers the SDKs used in almost 6 million apps across the Android ecosystem. This valuable resource helps developers make better SDK choices, boosts app quality and minimizes integration risks. 
</p>
<h2>Protecting the Android Ecosystem</h2>


<p>
Building on our success with the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/app-defense-alliance-migrates-under-jdf-with-google-meta-microsoft-as-steering-committee">App Defense Alliance</a> (ADA), we partnered with Microsoft and Meta as steering committee members in the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/evolving-app-defense-alliance.html">newly restructured ADA</a> under the <a href="https://jointdevelopment.org/">Joint Development Foundation</a>, part of the <a href="https://linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> family. The Alliance will support industry-wide adoption of app security best practices and guidelines, as well as countermeasures against emerging security risks.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, we announced new Play Store transparency labeling to <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/more-ways-for-users-to-identify.html">highlight VPN apps </a>that have completed an independent security review through App Defense Alliance’s <a href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/masa">Mobile App Security Assessment (MASA)</a>. When a user searches for VPN apps, they will now see a banner at the top of Google Play that educates them about the “Independent security review” badge in the Data safety section. This helps users see at-a-glance that a developer has prioritized security and privacy best practices and is committed to user safety.
</p>
<p>
To better protect our customers who install apps outside of the Play Store, we made Google Play Protect’s security capabilities even more powerful with <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/enhanced-google-play-protect-real-time.html">real-time scanning</a> at the code-level to combat novel malicious apps. Our security protections and machine learning algorithms learn from each app submitted to Google for review and we look at thousands of signals and compare app behavior. This new capability has already detected over 5 million new, malicious off-Play apps, which helps protect Android users worldwide.
</p>
<h2>More Stringent Developer Requirements and Guidelines</h2>


<p>
Last year we <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/10/announcing-policy-updates-to-support-app-quality-on-google-play.html">updated Play policies</a> around Generative AI apps, disruptive notifications, and expanded privacy protections. We also are raising the bar for new personal developer accounts by requiring <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14151465">new testing requirements</a> before developers can make their app available on Google Play. By testing their apps, getting feedback and ensuring everything is ready before they launch, developers are able to bring more high quality content to Play users. In order to increase trust and transparency, we’ve introduced <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">expanded developer verification requirements</a>, including D-U-N-S numbers for organizations and a new “About the developer” section.  
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/04/giving-people-more-control-over-their-data.html">To give users more control over their personal data</a>, apps that enable account creation now need to provide an option to initiate account and data deletion from within the app and online. This web requirement is especially important so that a user can request account and data deletion without having to reinstall an app. To simplify the user experience, we have also incorporated this as a feature within the Data safety section of the Play Store.
</p>
<p>
With each iteration of the Android operating system (including its robust set of APIs), a myriad of enhancements are introduced, aiming to elevate the user experience, bolster security protocols, and optimize the overall performance of the Android platform. To further safeguard our customers, approximately 1.5 million applications that do not target the most recent APIs are no longer available in the Play Store to new users who have updated their devices to the latest Android version.  
</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>


<p>
Protecting users and developers on Google Play is paramount and ever-evolving. We're launching new security initiatives in 2024, including removing apps from Play that are not transparent about their privacy practices. 
</p>
<p>
We also recently filed a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/04/google-sues-crypto-scammers-allegedly-uploading-fake-apps-android-app-store.html">lawsuit</a> in federal court against two fraudsters who made multiple misrepresentations to upload fraudulent investment and crypto exchange apps on Play to scam users. This lawsuit is a critical step in holding these bad actors accountable and sending a clear message that we will aggressively pursue those who seek to take advantage of our users. 
</p>
<p>
We're constantly working on new ways to protect your experience on Google Play and across the entire Android ecosystem, and we look forward to sharing more.

Instead, we use metrics and indicators to ensure it is working properly.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #4a86e8; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">Input processing</span></h3><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The type of data we process during incidents can be messy and often unstructured: Free-form text, logs, images, links, impact stats, timelines, and code snippets. We needed to structure all of that data so the LLM “knew” which part of the information serves what purpose. For that, we first replaced long and noisy sections of codes/logs by self-closing tags (&lt;Code Section/&gt; and &lt;Logs/&gt;) both to keep the structure while saving tokens for more important facts and to reduce risk of hallucinations.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">During prompt engineering, we refined this approach and added additional tags such as &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;Actions Taken&gt;, &lt;Impact&gt;, &lt;Mitigation History&gt;, &lt;Comment&gt; so the input’s structure becomes closely mirrored to our incident communication templates. The use of self-explanatory tags allowed us to convey implicit information to the model and provide us with aliases in the prompt for the guidelines or tasks, for example by stating “Summarize the &lt;Security Incident&gt;”.</span></p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNtXq_pV3yYUzlwKbKFzxQATIAM4iGIQZB0egooDFnYijJSmqLzdEkreuElXv235Nc4mRphPWFckH8ESCP0fBWl_MfoW8SttvPK8-ajMTKPT-e3RQjJmyMdwVxBFrtZc-UiRR0Ucp8yzyavcOnU0RvSSU22tCUQB-xeicCuQaLSVsmVrRdonsLWUwERw33/s12500/GenAI_IncidentInput%20(1).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="443" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNtXq_pV3yYUzlwKbKFzxQATIAM4iGIQZB0egooDFnYijJSmqLzdEkreuElXv235Nc4mRphPWFckH8ESCP0fBWl_MfoW8SttvPK8-ajMTKPT-e3RQjJmyMdwVxBFrtZc-UiRR0Ucp8yzyavcOnU0RvSSU22tCUQB-xeicCuQaLSVsmVrRdonsLWUwERw33/w603-h443/GenAI_IncidentInput%20(1).png" width="603" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;">Sample {incident} input</span></p><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #4a86e8; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">Prompt engineering</span></h3><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Once we added structure to the input, it was time to engineer the prompt.

We improved upon the initial summary prompt and ran an experiment to draft executive communications on behalf of the Incident Commander (IC). The goal of this experiment was to ensure executives and stakeholders quickly understand the incident facts, as well as allow ICs to relay important information around incidents. These communications are complex because they go beyond just a summary - they include different sections (such as summary, root cause, impact, and mitigation), follow a specific structure and format, as well as adhere to writing best practices (such as neutral tone, active voice instead of passive voice, minimize acronyms).</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">This experiment showed that generative AI can evolve beyond high level summarization and help draft complex communications.

<p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/reporting-1/">The Reporting API</a> is an emerging web standard that provides a generic reporting mechanism for issues occurring on the browsers visiting your production website. The reports you receive detail issues such as security violations or soon-to-be-deprecated APIs, from users’ browsers from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
Collecting reports is often as simple as specifying an endpoint URL in the HTTP header; the browser will automatically start forwarding reports covering the issues you are interested in to those endpoints. However, processing and analyzing these reports is not that simple. For example, you may receive a massive number of reports on your endpoint, and it is possible that not all of them will be helpful in identifying the underlying problem. In such circumstances, distilling and fixing issues can be quite a challenge.
</p>
<p>
In this blog post, we'll share how the Google security team uses the Reporting API to detect potential issues and identify the actual problems causing them. We'll also introduce an open source solution, so you can easily replicate Google's approach to processing reports and acting on them.
</p>
<h1>How does the Reporting API work?</h1>


<p>
Some errors only occur in production, on users’ browsers to which you have no access. You won't see these errors locally or during development because there could be unexpected conditions real users, real networks, and real devices are in. With the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/reporting-api">Reporting API</a>, you directly leverage the browser to monitor these errors: the browser catches these errors for you, generates an error report, and sends this report to an endpoint you've specified.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>
How reports are generated and sent.
</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Errors you can monitor with the Reporting API include:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Security violations: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content-Security-Policy (CSP)</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy">Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy">Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)</a>

</li><li>Deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated API calls

</li><li>Browser interventions

</li><li>Permissions policy

</li><li>And more 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For a full list of error types you can monitor, see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/reporting-api/#use_cases_and_report_types">use cases and report types</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Reporting API is activated and configured using HTTP response headers: you need to declare the endpoint(s) you want the browser to send reports to, and which error types you want to monitor. The browser then sends reports to your endpoint in POST requests whose payload is a list of reports.

The Reporting API is supported by Chrome, and partially by Safari as of March 2024. For details, see the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/reporting-api/#browser_support">browser support</a> table.  
</p>
<h1>Google's approach </h1>


<p>
Google benefits from being able to uplift security at scale. Web platform mitigations like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API">Trusted Types</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Fetch_metadata_request_header">Fetch Metadata</a>, and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy">Cross-Origin Opener Policy</a> help us engineer away entire classes of vulnerabilities across hundreds of Google products and thousands of individual services, as described in <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5896512897417216/a-recipe-for-scaling-security">this blogpost</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the engineering challenges of deploying security policies at scale is identifying code locations that are incompatible with new restrictions and that would break if those restrictions were enforced. There is a common 4-step process to solve this problem: 
</p>
<ol>

<li>Roll out policies in <em>report-only mode</em> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only">CSP report-only mode example</a>). This instructs browsers to execute client-side code as usual, but gather information on any events where the policy would be violated if it were enforced. This information is packaged in violation reports that are sent to a reporting endpoint.

</li><li>The violation reports must be triaged to link them to locations in code that are incompatible with the policy. For example, some code bases may be incompatible with security policies because they use a dangerous API or use patterns that mix user data and code.

</li><li>The identified code locations are refactored to make them compatible, for example by using safe versions of dangerous APIs or changing the way user input is mixed with code. These refactorings uplift the security posture of the code base by helping reduce the usage of dangerous coding patterns. 

</li><li>When all code locations have been identified and refactored, the policy can be removed from <em>report-only mode</em> and fully enforced. Note that in a typical roll out, we iterate steps 1 through 3 to ensure that we have triaged all violation reports. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
With the Reporting API, we have the ability to run this cycle using a unified reporting endpoint and a single schema for several security features. This allows us to gather reports for a variety of features across different browsers, code paths, and types of users in a centralized way.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>A violation report is generated when an entity is attempting an action that one of your policies forbids. For example, you've set CSP on one of your pages, but the page is trying to load a script that's not allowed by your CSP. Most reports generated via the Reporting API are violation reports, but not all — other types include deprecation reports and crash reports. For details, see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/reporting-api/#use_cases_and_report_types">Use cases and report types</a>.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it is common for noise to creep into streams of violation reports, which can make finding incompatible code locations difficult. For example, many browser extensions, malware, antivirus software, and devtools users inject third-party code into the DOM or use forbidden APIs. If the injected code is incompatible with the policy, this can lead to violation reports that cannot be linked to our code base and are therefore not actionable. This makes triaging reports difficult and makes it hard to be confident that all code locations have been addressed before enforcing new policies.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, Google has developed a number of techniques to collect, digest, and summarize violation reports into <em>root causes</em>.<em> </em>Here is a summary of the most useful techniques we believe developers can use to filter out noise in reported violations:
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Focus on root causes</h3>


<p>
It is often the case that a piece of code that is incompatible with the policy executes several times throughout the lifetime of a browser tab. Each time this happens, a new violation report is created and queued to be sent to the reporting endpoint. This can quickly lead to a large volume of individual reports, many of which contain redundant information. Because of this, grouping violation reports into clusters enables developers to abstract away individual violations and think in terms of root causes. Root causes are simpler to understand and can speed up the process of identifying useful refactorings. 
</p>
<p>
Let's take a look at an example to understand how violations may be grouped. For instance, a report-only CSP that forbids the use of inline JavaScript event handlers is deployed. Violation reports are created on every instance of those handlers and have the following fields set:
</p>
<ul>

<li>The <code>blockedURL</code> field is set to <code>inline</code>, which describes the type of violation.

</li><li>The <code>scriptSample</code> field is set to the first few bytes of the contents of the event handler in the field. 

</li><li>The <code>documentURL</code> field is set to the URL of the current browser tab. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most of the time, these three fields uniquely identify the inline handlers in a given URL, even if the values of other fields differ. This is common when there are tokens, timestamps, or other random values across page loads. Depending on your application or framework, the values of these fields can differ in subtle ways, so being able to do fuzzy matches on reporting values can go a long way in grouping violations into actionable clusters. In some cases, we can group violations whose URL fields have known prefixes, for example all violations with URLs that start with <code>chrome-extension</code>, <code>moz-extension</code>, or <code>safari-extension</code> can be grouped together to set root causes in browser extensions aside from those in our codebase with a high degree of confidence.
</p>
<p>
Developing your own grouping strategies helps you stay focused on root causes and can significantly reduce the number of violation reports you need to triage. In general, it should always be possible to select fields that uniquely identify interesting types of violations and use those fields to prioritize the most important root causes.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Leverage ambient information</h3>


<p>
Another way of distinguishing non-actionable from actionable violation reports is ambient information. This is data that is contained in requests to our reporting endpoint, but that is not included in the violation reports themselves. Ambient information can hint at sources of noise in a client's set up that can help with triage:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>User Agent or <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-security/user-agent-client-hints">User Agent client hints</a>:</strong> User agents are a great tell-tale sign of non-actionable violations. For example, crawlers, bots, and some mobile applications use custom user agents whose behavior differs from well-supported browser engines and that can trigger unique violations. In other cases, some violations may only trigger in a specific browser or be caused by changes in nightly builds or newer versions of browsers. Without user agent information, these violations would be significantly more difficult to investigate. <br />

</li><li><strong>Trusted users: </strong>Browsers will attach any available cookies to requests made to a reporting endpoint by the Reporting API, if the endpoint is same-site with the document where the violation occurs. Capturing cookies is useful for identifying the type of user that caused a violation. Often, the most actionable violations come from trusted users that are not likely to have invasive extensions or malware, like company employees or website administrators. If you are not able to capture authentication information through your reporting endpoint, consider rolling out report-only policies to trusted users first. Doing so allows you to build a baseline of actionable violations before rolling out your policies to the general public.<br />

</li><li><strong>Number of unique users: </strong>As a general principle, users of typical features or code paths should generate roughly the same violations. This allows us to flag violations seen by a small number of users as potentially suspicious, since they suggest that a user's particular setup might be at fault, rather than our application code. One way of 'counting users' is to keep note of the number of unique IP addresses that reported a violation. Approximate counting algorithms are simple to use and can help gather this information without tracking specific IP addresses. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog">HyperLogLog</a> algorithm requires just a few bytes to approximate the number of unique elements in a set with a high degree of confidence.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Map violations to source code (advanced)</h3>


<p>
Some types of violations have a <code>source_file</code> field or equivalent. This field represents the JavaScript file that triggered the violation and is usually accompanied by a line and column number. These three bits of data are a high-quality signal that can point directly to lines of code that need to be refactored. 
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it is often the case that source files fetched by browsers are compiled or minimized and don't map directly to your code base. In this case, we recommend you use JavaScript source maps to map line and column numbers between <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-104#authored-deployed">deployed and authored files</a>. This allows you to translate directly from violation reports to lines of source code, yielding highly actionable report groups and root causes.
</p>
<h1>Establish your own solution</h1>


<p>
The Reporting API sends browser-side events, such as security violations, deprecated API calls, and browser interventions, to the specified endpoint on a per-event basis. However, as explained in the previous section, to distill the real issues out of those reports, you need a data processing system on your end.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there are plenty of options in the industry to set up the required architecture, including open source products. The fundamental pieces of the required system are the following:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>API endpoint</strong>: A web server that accepts HTTP requests and handles reports in a JSON format

</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: A storage server that stores received reports and reports processed by the pipeline

</li><li><strong>Data pipeline</strong>: A pipeline that filters out noise and extracts and aggregates required metadata into constellations

</li><li><strong>Data visualizer</strong>: A tool that provides insights on the processed reports
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Solutions for each of the components listed above are made available by public cloud platforms, SaaS services, and as open source software. See the <a href="?tab=t.0#heading=h.8mq1xpwkxy0y">Alternative solutions</a> section for details, and the following section outlining a sample application.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Sample application: Reporting API Processor</h3>


<p>
To help you understand how to receive reports from browsers and how to handle these received reports, we created a <a href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/reporting-api-processor">small sample application</a> that demonstrates the following processes that are required for distilling web application security issues from reports sent by browsers:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Report ingestion to the storage

</li><li>Noise reduction and data aggregation

</li><li>Processed report data visualization
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although this sample is relying on Google Cloud, you can replace each of the components with your preferred technologies. An overview of the sample application is illustrated in the following diagram:
</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD_8vdQRYuPLcnfkVozbtRJgPHlvUnh2dWNnnqxke-z1yw0cvB8o8VhqV9zf5tTXK3VM1kbGodegk94CM9sy3Z5h9_wd6ckkQCa_NB-UnmHaJhIbYw7yRxvBqRN9PtTrgX7V7PoO3A8v0WIcjlNR8pdO2rtLVQp66WfAXG3Ta-GZG84pjvxIEJOyPOKwl5/s3146/Diagram.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD_8vdQRYuPLcnfkVozbtRJgPHlvUnh2dWNnnqxke-z1yw0cvB8o8VhqV9zf5tTXK3VM1kbGodegk94CM9sy3Z5h9_wd6ckkQCa_NB-UnmHaJhIbYw7yRxvBqRN9PtTrgX7V7PoO3A8v0WIcjlNR8pdO2rtLVQp66WfAXG3Ta-GZG84pjvxIEJOyPOKwl5/s16000/Diagram.png" /></a></div><br /><p><br /></p>
<p>
Components described as green boxes are components that you need to implement by yourself. <em>Forwarder </em>is a simple web server that receives reports in the JSON format and converts them to the schema for Bigtable. <em>Beam-collector</em> is a simple Apache Beam pipeline that filters noisy reports, aggregates relevant reports into the shape of constellations, and saves them as CSV files. These two components are the key parts to make better use of reports from the Reporting API.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Try it yourself</h3>


<p>
Because this is a runnable sample application, you are able to deploy all components to a Google Cloud project and see how it works by yourself. The detailed prerequisites and the instructions to set up the sample system are documented in the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/reporting-api-processor/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> file.
</p>
<h1>Alternative solutions</h1>


<p>
Aside from the open source solution we shared, there are a number of tools available to assist in your usage of the Reporting API. Some of them include:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Report-collecting services like <a href="https://report-uri.com/">report-uri</a> and <a href="https://www.uriports.com/">uriports</a>.

</li><li>Application error monitoring platforms like Sentry, Datadog, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Besides pricing, consider the following points when selecting alternatives:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Are you comfortable sharing any of your application's URLs with a third-party report collector? Even if the browser strips sensitive information from these URLs, sensitive information <a href="https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#capability-urls">may get leaked this way</a>. If this sounds too risky for your application, operate your own reporting endpoint.

</li><li>Does this collector support all report types you need? For example, not all reporting endpoint solutions support COOP/COEP violation reports.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Summary</h1>


<p>
In this article, we explained how web developers can collect client-side issues by using the Reporting API, and the challenges of distilling the real problems out of the collected reports. We also introduced how Google solves those challenges by filtering and processing reports, and shared an open source project that you can use to replicate a similar solution. We hope this information will motivate more developers to take advantage of the Reporting API and, in consequence, make their website more secure and sustainable.

<p>
Keeping people safe and their data secure and private is a top priority for Android. That is why we took our time when designing <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device/" target="_blank">the new Find My Device</a>, which uses a crowdsourced device-locating network to help you find your lost or misplaced devices and belongings quickly – even when they’re offline. We gave careful consideration to the potential user security and privacy challenges that come with device finding services. <br /><br />During development, it was important for us to ensure the new Find My Device was secure by default and private by design. To build a private, crowdsourced device-locating network, we first conducted user research and gathered feedback from privacy and advocacy groups. Next, we developed multi-layered protections across three main areas: data safeguards, safety-first protections, and user controls. This approach provides defense-in-depth for Find My Device users.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How location crowdsourcing works on the Find My Device network</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Find My Device network locates devices  by harnessing the Bluetooth proximity of surrounding Android devices. Imagine you drop your keys at a cafe. The keys themselves have no location capabilities, but they may have a Bluetooth tag attached. Nearby Android devices participating in the Find My Device network report the location of the Bluetooth tag. When the owner realizes they have lost their keys and logs into the Find My Device mobile app, they will be able to see the <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/14796936?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7651004&amp;sjid=3104889368197014343-NC" target="_blank">aggregated location</a> contributed by nearby Android devices and locate their keys. <br />

<p>
<strong>Find My Device network protections</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />Let’s dive into key details of the multi-layered protections for the Find My Device network:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Safeguards</span>:</strong> We’ve implemented protections that help ensure the privacy of everyone participating in the network and the crowdsourced location data that powers it.  
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Location data is end-to-end encrypted.</strong> When Android devices participating in the network report the location of a Bluetooth tag, the location is end-to-end encrypted using a key that is only accessible to the Bluetooth tag owner and anyone the owner has shared the tag with in the Find My Device app. Only the Bluetooth tag owner (and those they’ve chosen to share access with) can decrypt and view the tag’s location. With end-to-end encrypted location data, Google cannot decrypt, see, or otherwise use the location data. 
 
<li><strong>Private, crowdsourced location reports.</strong> These end-to-end encrypted locations are contributed to the Find My Device network in a manner that does not allow Google to identify the owners of the nearby Android devices that provided the location data. And when the Find My Device network shows the location and timestamp to the Bluetooth tag’s owner to help them find their belongings, no other information about the nearby Android devices that contributed the data is included. 
 
<li><strong>Minimizing network data</strong>. End-to-end encrypted location data is minimally buffered and frequently overwritten. In addition, if the network can help find a Bluetooth tag using the owner’s nearby devices (e.g., if their own phone detects the tag), the network will discard crowdsourced reports for the tag.<br />
</li> 
</ul>

<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Safety-first Protections</span>: </strong>The Find My Device network protects against risks such as use of an unknown Bluetooth tag to stalk or identify another user, including:  
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Aggregation by default. </strong>This is a first-of-its-kind safety protection that makes unwanted tracking to a private location, like your home, more difficult. By default, the Find My Device network requires multiple nearby Android devices to detect a tag before reporting its location to the tag's owner. Our research found that the Find My Device network is most valuable in public settings like cafes and airports, where there are likely many devices nearby. By implementing aggregation before showing a tag’s location to its owner, the network can take advantage of its biggest strength – over a billion Android devices that can participate. This helps tag owners find their lost devices in these busier locations while prioritizing safety from unwanted tracking near private locations. In less busy areas, last known location and <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7535860">Nest finding</a> are reliable ways to locate items.
 
<li><strong>At home protection.</strong> If a user has chosen to save their home address in their Google Account, their Android device will also ensure that it does not contribute crowdsourced location reports to the Find My Device network when it is near the user’s home. This provides additional protection on top of aggregation by default against unwanted tracking near private locations.
 
<li><strong>Rate limiting and throttling.</strong> The Find My Device network limits the number of times that a nearby Android device can contribute a location report for a particular Bluetooth tag. The network also throttles how frequently the owner of a Bluetooth tag can request an updated location for the tag. We've found that lost items are typically left behind in stationary spots. For example, you lose your keys at the cafe, and they stay at the table where you had your morning coffee. Meanwhile, a malicious user is often trying to engage in real-time tracking of a person. By applying rate limiting and throttling to reduce how often the location of a device is updated, the network continues to be helpful for finding items, like your lost checked baggage on a trip, while helping mitigate the risk of real-time tracking. 
 
<li><strong>Unknown tracker alerts. </strong>The Find My Device network is also compliant with the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/">integration version</a> of the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/google-and-apple-lead-initiative-for.html">joint industry standard</a> for unwanted tracking. Being compliant with the integration version of the standard means that both Android and iOS users will receive unknown tracker alerts if the on-device algorithm detects that someone may be using a Find My Device network-compatible tag to track them without their knowledge, proactively alerting the user through a notification on their phone.
</li> 
</ul>

<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Controls</span>: </strong>Android users always have full control over which of their devices participate in the Find My Device network and how those devices participate. Users can either stick with the default and contribute to aggregated location reporting, opt into contributing non-aggregated locations, or turn the network off altogether. Find My Device also provides the ability to <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/6160491?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7651004" target="_blank">secure or erase data from a lost device</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to careful security architectural design, the new Find My Device network has undergone internal Android red team testing. The Find My Device network has also been added to the <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/6171833274204160/android-and-google-devices-security-reward-program-rules">Android security vulnerability rewards program</a> to take advantage of Android’s global ecosystem of security researchers. We’re also engaging with select researchers through our private grant program to encourage more targeted research.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Prioritizing user safety on Find My Device </strong>
</p>
<p>
Together, these multi-layered user protections help mitigate potential risks to user privacy and safety while allowing users to effectively locate and recover lost devices.
</p>
<p>
As bad actors continue to look for new ways to exploit users, our work to help keep users safe on Android is never over. We have an unwavering commitment to continue to improve user protections on Find My Device and prioritize user safety.

Google Public DNS). The path from a client to the resolver is usually on a local network or can be protected using encrypted transports like DoH, DoT. The resolver queries authoritative DNS servers to obtain answers for user queries. This communication primarily occurs over UDP, an insecure connectionless protocol, in which messages can be easily spoofed including the source IP address.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Jasika Bawa, Xinghui Lu, Google Chrome Security &amp; Jonathan Li, Alex Wozniak, Google Safe Browsing
</span>
<p>
For more than 15 years, Google Safe Browsing has been protecting users from phishing, malware, unwanted software and more, by identifying and warning users about potentially abusive sites on more than 5 billion devices around the world. As attackers grow more sophisticated, we've seen the need for protections that can adapt as quickly as the threats they defend against. That’s why we're excited to announce a new version of Safe Browsing that will provide real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection for people using the <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866">Standard protection</a> mode of Safe Browsing in Chrome.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Current landscape</h3>


<p>
Chrome automatically protects you by flagging potentially dangerous sites and files, hand in hand with Safe Browsing which discovers thousands of unsafe sites every day and adds them to its lists of harmful sites and files.
</p>
<p>
So far, for privacy and performance reasons, Chrome has first checked sites you visit against a locally-stored list of known unsafe sites which is updated every 30 to 60 minutes  –&nbsp;this is done using <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/08/how-hash-based-safe-browsing-works-in.html">hash-based checks</a>.
</p>
<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_QBMYx1Gz7H8twUQnE1pRiD8H0m2ckUodFJL0ySh23eh8foVsehxwVO9eu_JwL2BRI1LLUSEKFhJZsHx9IqHBzNCanJpKwHS0hNWn_nJL85jL64nQZTFJMqAkKc0KuU0Q6BnKGiAptLQUFSaHF1lZ1JfrBUxufZx8OPdFw1vjgoFhSjvaMSfZSsQXs2cz/s1428/Screenshot%202024-03-13%203.39.50%20PM.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_QBMYx1Gz7H8twUQnE1pRiD8H0m2ckUodFJL0ySh23eh8foVsehxwVO9eu_JwL2BRI1LLUSEKFhJZsHx9IqHBzNCanJpKwHS0hNWn_nJL85jL64nQZTFJMqAkKc0KuU0Q6BnKGiAptLQUFSaHF1lZ1JfrBUxufZx8OPdFw1vjgoFhSjvaMSfZSsQXs2cz/s16000/Screenshot%202024-03-13%203.39.50%20PM.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Hash-based check overview</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
But unsafe sites have adapted — today, the majority of them exist for less than 10 minutes, meaning that by the time the locally-stored list of known unsafe sites is updated, many have slipped through and had the chance to do damage if users happened to visit them during this window of opportunity. Further, Safe Browsing’s list of harmful websites continues to grow at a rapid pace. Not all devices have the resources necessary to maintain this growing list, nor are they always able to receive and apply updates to the list at the frequency necessary to benefit from full protection.
</p>
<p>
Safe Browsing’s <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2020/05/enhanced-safe-browsing-protection-now.html">Enhanced protection</a> mode already stays ahead of such threats with technologies such as real-time list checks and AI-based classification of malicious URLs and web pages. We built this mode as an opt-in to give users the choice of sharing more security-related data in order to get stronger security. This mode has shown that checking lists in real time brings significant value, so we decided to bring that to the default Standard protection mode through a new API – one that doesn't share the URLs of sites you visit with Google.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Introducing real-time, privacy-preserving Safe Browsing</h3>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">How it works</h2>


<p>
In order to transition to real-time protection, checks now need to be performed against a list that is maintained on the Safe Browsing server. The server-side list can include unsafe sites as soon as they are discovered, so it is able to capture sites that switch quickly. It can also grow as large as needed because the Safe Browsing server is not constrained in the same way that user devices are.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, here's what is happening in Chrome:
</p>
<ol>

<li>When you visit a site, Chrome first checks its cache to see if the address (URL) of the site is already known to be safe (see the “Staying speedy and reliable” section for details).

</li><li>If the visited URL is not in the cache, it may be unsafe, so a real-time check is necessary.

</li><li>Chrome obfuscates the URL by following the <a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/urls-hashing">URL hashing guidance</a> to convert the URL into 32-byte full hashes. 

</li><li>Chrome truncates the full hashes into 4-byte long hash prefixes.

</li><li>Chrome encrypts the hash prefixes and sends them to a privacy server (see the “Keeping your data private” section for details).

</li><li>The privacy server removes potential user identifiers and forwards the encrypted hash prefixes to the Safe Browsing server via a TLS connection that mixes requests with many other Chrome users.

</li><li>The Safe Browsing server decrypts the hash prefixes and matches them against the server-side database, returning full hashes of all unsafe URLs that match one of the hash prefixes sent by Chrome.

</li><li>After receiving the unsafe full hashes, Chrome checks them against the full hashes of the visited URL.

</li><li>If any match is found, Chrome will show a warning.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Keeping your data private</h2>


<p>
In order to preserve user privacy, we have partnered with <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/enabling-privacy-on-the-internet-with-oblivious-http">Fastly</a>, an edge cloud platform that provides content delivery, edge compute, security, and observability services, to operate an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9458/">Oblivious HTTP</a> (OHTTP) privacy server between Chrome and Safe Browsing – you can learn more about Fastly's commitment to user privacy on their <a href="https://www.fastly.com/solutions/customer-trust">Customer Trust page</a>. With OHTTP, Safe Browsing does not see your IP address, and your Safe Browsing checks are mixed amongst those sent by other Chrome users. This means Safe Browsing cannot correlate the URL checks you send as you browse the web.
</p>
<p>
Before hash prefixes leave your device, Chrome encrypts them using a public key from Safe Browsing. These encrypted hash prefixes are then sent to the privacy server. Since the privacy server doesn’t know the private key, it cannot decrypt the hash prefixes, which offers privacy from the privacy server itself.
</p>
<p>
The privacy server then removes potential user identifiers such as your IP address and forwards the encrypted hash prefixes to the Safe Browsing server. The privacy server is operated independently by Fastly, meaning that Google doesn’t have access to potential user identifiers (including IP address and User Agent) from the original request. Once the Safe Browsing server receives the encrypted hash prefixes from the privacy server, it decrypts the hash prefixes with its private key and then continues to check the server-side list.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Safe Browsing sees the hash prefixes of your URL but not your IP address, and the privacy server sees your IP address but not the hash prefixes. No single party has access to both your identity and the hash prefixes. As such, your browsing activity remains private.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWX4X0IOWMDxOgv4_2z033z3i327gXtjV0U0eTdW2XRAxKJPp-_oaIplWUUwJBgt-UNvwNnhlHNPz30O26SVDKK1GImmt_-L0qYhMT-P8N00bMv3ufXZw4TxxTQoTOsXUWx7wUNzoQ05AQwdJn9vXMJmBQR-HG3yY1yW09GrvK1XXrF7Awe3mTxTnY9N-1/s2030/Screenshot%202024-03-13%203.41.41%20PM.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWX4X0IOWMDxOgv4_2z033z3i327gXtjV0U0eTdW2XRAxKJPp-_oaIplWUUwJBgt-UNvwNnhlHNPz30O26SVDKK1GImmt_-L0qYhMT-P8N00bMv3ufXZw4TxxTQoTOsXUWx7wUNzoQ05AQwdJn9vXMJmBQR-HG3yY1yW09GrvK1XXrF7Awe3mTxTnY9N-1/s16000/Screenshot%202024-03-13%203.41.41%20PM.png" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Real-time check overview</em>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Staying speedy and reliable</h2>


<p>
Compared with the hash-based check, the real-time check requires sending a request to a server, which adds additional latency. We have employed a few techniques to make sure your browsing experience continues to be smooth and responsive.
</p>
<p>
First, before performing the real-time check, Chrome checks against a global and local cache on your device to avoid unnecessary delay.
</p>
<ul>

<li>The global cache is a list of hashes of known-safe URLs that is served by Safe Browsing. Chrome fetches it in the background. If any full hash of the URL is found in the global cache, Chrome will consider it less risky and perform a hash-based check instead.

</li><li>The local cache, on the other hand, is a list of full hashes that are saved from previous Safe Browsing checks. If there is a match in the local cache, and the cache has not yet expired, Chrome will not send a real-time request to the Safe Browsing server.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both caches are stored in memory, so it is much faster to check them than sending a real-time request over the network.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Chrome follows a fallback mechanism in case of unsuccessful or slow requests. If the real-time request fails consecutively, Chrome will enter a back-off mode and downgrade the checks to hash-based checks for a certain period.
</p>
<p>
We are also in the process of introducing an <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/02/optimizing-safe-browsing-checks-in.html">asynchronous mechanism</a>, which will allow the site to load while the real-time check is in progress. This will improve the user experience, as the real-time check won’t block page load.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection means for you</h3>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">Chrome users</h2>


<p>
With the latest release of Chrome for desktop, Android, and iOS, we’re upgrading the Standard protection mode of Safe Browsing so it will now check sites using Safe Browsing’s real-time protection protocol, without sharing your browsing history with Google. You don't need to take any action to benefit from this improved functionality.
</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_2OYwTAxTggg27lIbawjb3dauEA8leW3aXfhYH-_xVjs-b_VASp92zpqARvsUX37tJKY4r6isvOE7KuHzo-PCGrfq-1R5rblAbpH2eDHi1NdWGzMdae43y143xiaYLS5DhKzbq0FEjkadtT0lzktQq2HcjBlAbKykUCn0CyJaQmIjeCV4gY3eVtnWd1q1/s3200/Red%20interstitial.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_2OYwTAxTggg27lIbawjb3dauEA8leW3aXfhYH-_xVjs-b_VASp92zpqARvsUX37tJKY4r6isvOE7KuHzo-PCGrfq-1R5rblAbpH2eDHi1NdWGzMdae43y143xiaYLS5DhKzbq0FEjkadtT0lzktQq2HcjBlAbKykUCn0CyJaQmIjeCV4gY3eVtnWd1q1/s16000/Red%20interstitial.png" /></a></div>
<p>
If you want more protection, we still encourage you to turn on the <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866">Enhanced protection</a> mode of Safe Browsing. You might wonder why you need enhanced protection when you'll be getting real-time URL protection in Standard protection – this is because in Standard protection mode, the real-time feature can only protect you from sites that Safe Browsing has already confirmed to be unsafe. On the other hand, Enhanced protection mode is able to use additional information together with advanced machine learning models to protect you from sites that Safe Browsing may not yet have confirmed to be unsafe, for example because the site was only very recently created or is cloaking its true behavior to Safe Browsing’s detection systems. 
</p>
<p>
Enhanced protection also continues to offer protection beyond real-time URL checks, for example by providing deep scans for suspicious files and extra protection from suspicious Chrome extensions.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Enterprises</h2>


<p>
The real-time feature of the Standard protection mode of Safe Browsing is on by default for Chrome. If needed, it may be configured using the policy <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SafeBrowsingProxiedRealTimeChecksAllowed">SafeBrowsingProxiedRealTimeChecksAllowed</a>. It is also worth noting that in order for this feature to work in Chrome, enterprises may need to explicitly allow traffic to the Fastly privacy server. If the server is not reachable, Chrome will downgrade the checks to hash-based checks.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Developers</h2>


<p>
While Chrome is the first surface where these protections are available, we plan to make them available to eligible developers for non-commercial use cases via the Safe Browsing API. Using the API, developers and privacy server operators can partner to better protect their products’ users from fast-moving malicious actors in a privacy-preserving manner. To learn more, keep an eye out for our upcoming developer documentation to be published on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/">Google for Developers</a> site.

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Sarah Jacobus, Vulnerability Rewards Team</span>

<p>
Last year, we again witnessed the power of community-driven security efforts as researchers from around the world contributed to help us identify and address thousands of vulnerabilities in our products and services. Working with our dedicated bug hunter community, we awarded $10 million to our 600+ researchers based in 68 countries. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>New Resources and Improvements</strong>
</p>
<p>
Just like every year, 2023 brought a series of changes and improvements to our vulnerability reward programs:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Through our new <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5429687846305792/bonus-awards-rules">Bonus Awards</a> program, we now periodically offer time-limited, extra rewards for reports to specific VRP targets.

<li>We expanded our <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/expanding-our-exploit-reward-program-to.html">exploit reward program</a> to Chrome and Cloud through the launch of  v8CTF, a CTF focused on V8, the JavaScript engine that powers Chrome.

<li>We launched <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/6618732618186752/google-mobile-vulnerability-reward-program-rules">Mobile VRP</a> which focuses on first-party Android applications.

<li>Our <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog">new Bughunters blog</a> shared ways in which we make the internet, as a whole, safer, and what that journey entails. Take a look at our ever-growing repository of posts!

<li>To further our engagement with top security researchers, we also hosted our yearly security conference ESCAL8 in Tokyo. It included live hacking events and competitions, student training with our <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleVRP/status/1711207378283360435">init.g workshops</a>, and talks from researchers and Googlers. Stay tuned for details on ESCAL8 2024.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As in <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/02/vulnerability-reward-program-2022-year.html">past years</a>, we are sharing our 2023 Year in Review statistics across all of our programs. We would like to give a special thank you to all of our dedicated researchers for their continued work with our programs - we look forward to more collaboration in the future! 
</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>Android and Google Devices</strong>
</p>
<p>
In 2023, the Android VRP achieved significant milestones, reflecting our dedication to securing the Android ecosystem. We awarded over $3.4 million in rewards to researchers who uncovered remarkable vulnerabilities within Android and <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/new-android-google-device-VRP.html">increased our maximum reward amount</a> to $15,000 for critical vulnerabilities. We also saw a sharpened focus on higher severity issues as a result of our changes to incentivize report quality and increasing rewards for high and critical severity issues. 
</p>
<p>
Expanding our program’s scope, Wear OS has been added to the program to further incentivize research in new wearable technology to ensure users’ safety.
</p>
<p>
Working closely with top researchers at the ESCAL8 conference, we also hosted a live hacking event for Wear OS and Android Automotive OS which resulted in $70,000 rewarded to researchers for finding over 20 critical vulnerabilities!
</p>
<p>
We would also like to spotlight the <a href="http://hardwear.io">hardwear.io</a> security conferences. Hardwear.io gave us a platform to engage with top hardware security researchers who uncovered over 50 vulnerabilities in Nest, Fitbit, and Wearables, and received a total of $116,000 last year!
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5604090422493184/google-play-security-reward-program-rules">Google Play Security Reward Program</a> continued to foster security research across popular Android apps on Google Play.
</p>
<p>
A huge thank you to the researchers who made our program such a success. A special shout out to Zinuo Han (<a href="https://twitter.com/ele7enxxh">@ele7enxxh</a>) of OPPO Amber Security Lab and Yu-Cheng Lin (林禹成) (<a href="https://twitter.com/AndroBugs">@AndroBugs</a>) for your hard work and continuing to be some of the top researchers contributing to Android VRPs!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Chrome<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
2023 was a year of changes and experimentation for the <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp">Chrome VRP</a>. In Chrome Milestone 116, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/09/use-after-freedom-miracleptr.html">MiraclePtr</a> was launched across all Chrome platforms. This resulted in raising the difficulty of discovery of fully exploitable non-renderer UAFs in Chrome and resulted in lower reward amounts for MiraclePtr-protected UAFs, as <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp/##reward-amounts-for-mitigated-security-bugs">highly mitigated security bugs</a>. While code and issues protected by MiraclePtr are expected to be resilient to the exploitation of non-renderer UAFs, the Chrome VRP launched the <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp/#miracleptr-bypass-reward">MiraclePtr Bypass Reward </a>to incentivize research toward discovering potential bypasses of this protection.
</p>
<p>
The Chrome VRP also launched the <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp/#full-chain-exploit-bonus">Full Chain Exploit Bonus</a>, offering triple the standard full reward amount for the first Chrome full-chain exploit reported and double the standard full reward amount for any follow-up reports. While both of these large incentives have gone unclaimed, we are leaving the door open in 2024 for any researchers looking to take on these challenges.
</p>
<p>
In 2023, Chrome VRP also introduced increased rewards for V8 bugs in older channels of Chrome, with an additional bonus for bugs existing before M105. This resulted in a few very impactful reports of long-existing V8 bugs, including one report of a V8 JIT optimization bug in Chrome since at least M91, which resulted in a $30,000 reward for that researcher.
</p>
<p>
All of this resulted in $2.1M in rewards to security researchers for 359 unique reports of Chrome Browser security bugs. We were also able to meet some of our top researchers from previous years who were invited to participate in bugSWAT as part of Google’s ESCAL8 event in Tokyo in October. We capped off the year by publicly <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41482500">announcing </a>our 2023 Top 20 Chrome VRP reporters who received a bonus reward for their contributions. 
</p>
<p>
Thank you to the Chrome VRP security researcher community for your contributions and efforts to help us make Chrome more secure for everyone!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Generative AI<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
Last year, we also ran a bugSWAT live-hacking event targeting LLM products. Apart from fun, sun, and a lot to do, we also got 35 reports, totaling more than $87,000 - and discovered issues like Johann, Joseph, and Kai’s “<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/google-bard-data-exfiltration/">Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration</a>” and Roni, Justin, and Joseph’s “<a href="https://www.landh.tech/blog/20240304-google-hack-50000/">We Hacked Google A.I. for $50,000</a>”.
</p>
<p>
To help AI-focused bughunters know what’s in scope and what’s not, we recently published our <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/googles-reward-criteria-for-reporting.html">criteria for bugs in AI products</a>. This criteria aims to facilitate testing for traditional security vulnerabilities as well as risks specific to AI systems, and is one way that we are implementing the<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ensuring-Safe-Secure-and-Trustworthy-AI.pdf"> voluntary AI commitments</a> that Google made at the White House in July.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>Looking Forward<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
We remain committed to fostering collaboration, innovation, and transparency with the security community. Our ongoing mission is to stay ahead of emerging threats, adapt to evolving technologies, and continue to strengthen the security posture of Google’s products and services. We look forward to continuing to drive greater advancements in the world of cybersecurity.<br />
</p>
<p>
A huge thank you to our bug hunter community for helping to make Google products and platforms more safe and secure for our users around the world! 
</p>

Since then, memory safety risks have grown more obvious. Like others', Google's internal vulnerability data and research show that memory safety bugs are widespread and one of the leading causes of vulnerabilities in memory-unsafe codebases. Those vulnerabilities endanger end users, our industry, and the broader society.

<title>CVE-2024-38213: Copy2Pwn Exploit Evades Windows Web Protections</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class=""><em>Zero Day Initiative threat researchers discovered CVE-2024-38213, a simple and effective way to bypass Windows mark-of-the-web protections leading to remote code execution.</em></p><p class="">In March 2024, Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative Threat Hunting team started analyzing samples connected to the activity carried out by DarkGate operators to infect users through copy-and-paste operations. This DarkGate campaign was an update from a <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/c/cve-2024-21412--darkgate-operators-exploit-microsoft-windows-sma.html">previous campaign</a>&nbsp; in which the DarkGate operators were exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21412">CVE-2024-21412</a>, which we disclosed to Microsoft earlier this year. </p><p class="">The investigation into this campaign directly influenced further vulnerability research into Windows Defender SmartScreen and how files originating from WebDAV shares are handled during copy-and-paste operations. As a result, we discovered and reported CVE-2024-38213 to Microsoft, which they patched in June. This exploit, which we've named copy2pwn, results in a file from a WebDAV share being copied locally without Mark-of-the-Web protections.</p><h2>What is Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)?</h2><p class="">Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It provides added functionality to HTTP, including features such as authoring, sharing, and versioning.</p>





















  
  



<p>Since WebDAV is based on HTTP, WebDAV shares can be accessed through a web browser using the HTTP protocol, for example, at <code>http://10.37.129.2/example_webdav_folder/somefile</code>. When a file is downloaded from a WebDAV share using a browser such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, it is treated the same as any other file downloaded from the web. As expected, the local copy of the file is marked with the Mark-of-the-Web.  </p>
<p>On Windows, users can also access and mount WebDAV shares via UNC paths, such as <code>\\10.37.129.2@80\example_webdav_folder</code>. A user can browse to a path of this form using Windows Explorer. This functions in a similar manner to accessing SMB shares through Windows. When accessing files in this manner, they are handled directly by the Windows operating system and not by the browser.</p>




  <h2>Threat Actors and WebDAV Shares</h2><p class="">Recently, we’ve seen an increase in threat actors hosting payloads on WebDAV shares. This activity has led to the discovery of numerous vulnerabilities abused as zero-days clustered around accessing malicious payloads from WebDAV shares. These include vulnerabilities such as <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36025">CVE-2023-36025</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21412">CVE-2024-21412</a>, with an additional fix from Microsoft in the form of <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29988">CVE-2024-29988</a>. These vulnerabilities center around Mark-of-the-Web bypasses and evading built-in Microsoft protections such as Windows Defender SmartScreen. </p><p class="">As mentioned, WebDAV shares accessed through Windows Explorer are handled by the Windows operating system as opposed to a browser. &nbsp;Many threat actors are aware of the implications of this with regard to Mark-of-the-Web. During our threat-hunting investigations, we uncovered many threat actors deploying an easy method utilizing the Windows search protocol to open WebDAV searches through Windows Explorer.</p>

  <p class="">Using the logic from Figure 1, threat actors can exercise a high degree of control over what the end user sees on the WebDAV share. This is done by crafting a specific Windows search query that only displays those files the threat actor wants the user to see. Furthermore, by utilizing certain file types such as Internet Shortcut (.url) or Shortcut (.lnk), the threat actor may change the file icon to make it appear as if the malicious file is a completely different type. This lures the user into inadvertently executing scripts or binaries.</p>

  <p class="">Under normal circumstances, files served over WebDAV would receive the Mark-of-the-Web and Windows Defender SmartScreen protections. However, there are a cluster of vulnerabilities mentioned above, and possibly more, that can be used for evasion.</p><h2>The Importance of Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) Protections</h2>





















  
  



<p>When a user downloads a file from an untrusted source such as the web, Windows adds the Mark-of-the-Web to the local copy of the file. The Mark-of-the-Web consists of an NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) with the name Zone.Identifier. Within this stream is the text <code>ZoneId=3</code>, indicating that the file originated from an untrusted source.</p>

  <p class="">Unfortunately, threat actors have discovered that Windows does not always handle or properly apply the Mark-of-the-Web to files served over WebDAV. Historically, Windows has treated WebDAV shares more akin to SMB shares, as opposed to HTTP web servers. This can be quite dangerous.</p><h2>Bypassing Mark-of-the-Web Protections with CVE-2024-38213</h2><p class="">Before the release of the Microsoft June security patch, files copied and pasted from WebDAV shares did not receive the Mark-of-the-Web designations. This meant that users might copy and paste files from a WebDAV share to their desktop, and those files could subsequently be opened without the protections of Windows Defender SmartScreen or Microsoft Office Protected View. In particular, this means that there would be no reputation or signature checks on executables.</p>





















  
  






  <p class="">Copy and paste operations are ubiquitous so Windows users need to ensure that they are fully protected from <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clipboard-hijacking-attack/" target="_blank" title="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clipboard-hijacking-attack/">clipboard hijacking</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pastejacking/" target="_blank" title="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pastejacking/">pastejacking</a>&nbsp;, and copy2pwn attacks, especially in light of recent threat actor activity leveraging WebDAV shares for payload deployment.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p class="">The Zero Day Initiative Threat Hunting Team constantly monitors for new and emerging zero-day threats. During our analysis of existing and previous threat actors and APT activities, we often discover new tactics, techniques, procedures, and hidden zero-day vulnerabilities. </p><p class="">This case emphasizes the integration of ZDI threat hunting with proactive vulnerability research within the ZDI program. By combining threat research with the Zero Day Initiative's core vulnerability research program, the ZDI Threat Hunting Team can develop new adversarial models and simulate new attack strategies as they might occur in the real world. This integration enables us to protect and defend customers from potentially hidden attack methods and chains before threat actors can incorporate them into their attack strategies.</p><p class="">We’ll be back with more findings as we have them.

<title>Announcing Pwn2Own Ireland – Bringing Pwn2Own (and WhatsApp) to the Emerald Isle</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/7/16/announcing-pwn2own-ireland-2024</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/7/16/announcing-pwn2own-ireland-2024</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class=""><em>If you just want to read the rules, you can find them </em><a href="https://zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnIreland2024Rules.html" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Over the last few years, our consumer-focused Pwn2Own event took place in the Trend Micro office in Toronto. However, that office closed, so we needed to find a new home. This isn’t unusual for this event, as it moved from Amsterdam to Tokyo to Austin to Toronto. We’re moving again. This year, we are heading to our offices in Cork, Ireland! We’re excited about our new location, and I personally have <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/IimtaPyt7uE?feature=share" target="_blank">viewed</a> several locations for after-hours and special events. Some of those will be secret until the competition, but I can tell you that our awards ceremony and end-of-contest party will be held at the historic <a href="https://corkcitygaol.com/" target="_blank">Cork City Goal</a>. It promises to be a fun and spooky event, and we’ll have more details about that in the future.</p><p class="">Beyond our new location, we’re excited to announce <strong>Meta</strong> has joined as a sponsor of this event and will participate in the new Messenger App category. That’s right – <strong>WhatsApp</strong> will be a target, with both 0-click and 1-click exploits being in scope. We’re offering $300,000 USD for a 0-click, so we hope to see some great research on an application used by millions. We’re also excited to announce the return of <strong>Synology</strong> as a co-sponsor of the event and <strong>QNAP</strong> joins them as a co-sponsor. </p><p class="">The Messenger App category isn’t the only exciting thing heading to Ireland. This will be our first competition to feature AI-enabled devices. Both the Samsung and Google phones include <a href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/smartphones/galaxy-s24/?cid=ca_pd_ppc_google_f1h24-galaxy-s24-series_launch_im-hhp-retention_text_rtb_20180102-w-samsung%20galaxy%20s24&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7sPGn7WshwMViG8PAh1PfQdiEAAYASAAEgJoF_D_BwE#:~:text=Buy%20now-,Galaxy%20AI%20is%20here,-Welcome%20to%20the">Galaxy AI</a> and <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/categories/ai/">Google AI</a> respectively. Multiple Synology devices use AI for tasks such as people and vehicle recognition on the cameras and AI-driven photo albums on their NAS devices. The Ubiquiti camera also uses AI for greater detection precision and range. There’s no special bonus for exploiting an AI feature, but it will be interesting to see if AI helps or hurts exploit attempts.</p><p class="">Last year’s favorite category was the “SOHO Smashup”, and it returns for another year. This category challenges contestants by having them start by exploiting the external interface of a router, compromise the router, and then pivot to another device connected to the network. In the Toronto event last year, several teams had winning entries in this category. It’s always amazing to watch the researchers as they pivot through multiple attack surfaces to hit their final goal. We’re also bringing wired and wireless cameras back into the contest under the surveillance category. Last year, we awarded $1,038,500 during the event for 58 unique 0-days. It will be interesting to see if the luck of the Irish will take that number up or down.</p><p class="">As for the contest itself, it will run from October 22-25, 2024. As always, we’ll have a random drawing to determine the schedule of attempts on the first day of the contest, and we will proceed from there. Registration closes at 5:00 p.m. Irish Standard Time on Oct 17th, 2024. There are no exceptions for late entries, so if you have questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:pwn2own@trendmicro.com">pwn2own@trendmicro.com</a> (note the new address). We will be happy to address your issues or concerns directly.</p><p class="">Now on to the specific target categories. We’ll have seven different categories for this year’s event:</p>





















  
  



<p><a name="top"></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#phones">- Mobile Phones</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#whatsapp">- Messenger Apps</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#soho">- The SOHO Smashup</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#cams">- Surveilance Systems</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#hubs">- Home Automation Hubs</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#printer">- Printers</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#speaker">- Smart Speakers</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#nas">- NAS Devices</a>  </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at each category in more detail, starting with mobile phones.</p>
<p><a name="phones"></a></p>
<p><b>The Target Phones</b></p>




  <p class="">Back in Amsterdam where this contest originated, it was originally dubbed “Mobile Pwn2Own” and our focus was strictly on phones. Mobile handsets remain at the heart of this event, and some of the Samsung entries from last year were absolutely smashing. As always, these phones will be running the latest version of their respective operating systems with all available updates installed. You may notice there are no Xiaomi devices in this year’s event. That’s because, during the contest last year, they took measures to ensure attempts would fail. They didn’t seem to mind that those measures impacted all of their users globally. While we do encourage shenanigans, that’s a bit too far to be considered fair. Thus, they are not returning. If you want more details about what happened, be sure to check out Ken Gannon and Ilyes Beghdadi’s upcoming <a href="https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-speakers.html#54454" target="_blank">DEFCON talk</a> about the subject.</p><p class="">In this category, contestants must compromise the device by browsing to content in the default browser for the target under test or by communicating with the following short-distance protocols: near field communication (NFC), Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. The awards for this category are:</p>

  <p class="">The Google and Apple devices in this category also include an add-on bonus. If your exploit payload executes with kernel-level privileges, you earn an additional <strong>$50,000</strong> and 5 more Master of Pwn points. That means a full exploit chain that includes kernel-level access on the iPhone or Pixel will earn <strong>$300,000 </strong>and 30 Master of Pwn points.</p>





















  
  



<p><a name="whatsapp"></a>
<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a></p>
<p><b>Messenger Apps</b></p>




  <p class="">Almost everyone uses some messenger app in their daily lives, and these apps have been the target of sophisticated threats in the past. We’re excited that Meta has agreed to sponsor this event and are hopeful that one (or more) of our contestants will demonstrate a WhatsApp exploit. Both 0-click and 1-click exploits are in scope. All valid submissions must use vulnerabilities reachable via WhatsApp and must not depend on other applications. All WhatsApp entries will be run on a Google Pixel 8.</p>

<p><a name="soho"></a>
<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a></p>
<p><b>The SOHO Smashup</b></p>




  <p class="">The proliferation of WFH resulted in many enterprises finding their network perimeter relocated to the home office. Threat actors exploiting home routers and consumer devices can use these as a launch point for lateral movements into enterprise resources. We wanted to demonstrate this during the contest, which means the SOHO Smashup category continues to be relevant. Contestants will need to first compromise the WAN port on a selected router. Once they accomplish that not-so-insignificant feat, they will need to pivot to one of the other devices and compromise it as well. The contestant is free to select any combination of router and home automation hub, smart speaker, printer, or network-attached storage device during the registration process – although you won’t have some of the same easy targets as last year. If they get both devices within 30 minutes, they earn $100,000 and 10 Master of Pwn points. </p>

<p><b>Surveillance Systems</b></p>




  <p class="">Last year, we introduced this category not knowing what to expect. As usual, our contestants did not disappoint as they unleashed some fantastic exploits – including taking over a camera just by showing it a QR code. Cameras continue to be a part of daily life, and we can’t wait to see what research is put on display this year. An attempt in this category must be launched against the target’s exposed network services or the target’s exposed features from the contestant’s laptop within the contest network.</p>

<p><b>Home Automation Hubs</b></p>




  <p class="">Many of the cameras and other “smart” devices are connected to a centralized hub. From lights to locks to thermostats, cameras, and more, all can be accessed through a home automation hub. Of course, that means a threat actor could potentially access them as well. This year, we’re introducing the AeoTec Smart Home Hub in this category, so we’ll see if our contestants take a run at it. Here are the targets in the Home Automation category:</p>

  <p class="">Printers have long been the source of jokes and memes, but they are also an often overlooked attack surface in your office. The printer category always produces some interesting results, often by playing music it shouldn’t or the occasional Rick Roll. It will be interesting to see what exploits the contestants come up with this year.</p>

  <p class=""><strong>Master of Pwn</strong></p><p class="">No Pwn2Own contest would be complete without crowning a Master of Pwn, which signifies the overall winner of the competition. Earning the title results in a slick <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eyexso3WUAYbXPK?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096">trophy</a>, a different sort of <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1240400682034909187">wearable</a>, and brings with it an additional 65,000 ZDI reward points (instant <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/about/benefits/">Platinum</a> status in 2025).</p><p class="">For those not familiar with how it works, points are accumulated for each successful attempt. While only the first demonstration in a category wins the full cash award, each successful entry claims the full number of Master of Pwn points. Since the order of attempts is determined by a random draw, those who receive later slots can still claim the Master of Pwn title – even if they earn a lower cash payout. As with previous contests, there are penalties for withdrawing from an attempt once you register for it. If the contestant decides to remove an Add-on Bonus during their attempt, the Master of Pwn points for that Add-on Bonus will be deducted from the final point total for that attempt. For example, someone registers for the Apple iPhone 15 with the Kernel Bonus Add-on. During the attempt, the contestant drops the Kernel Bonus Add-on but completes the attempt. The final point total will be 20 Master of Pwn points.</p><p class=""><strong>The Complete Details</strong></p><p class="">The full set of rules for Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 can be found <a href="https://zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnIreland2024Rules.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p class=""><em>In this guest blog from Master of Pwn winner Manfred Paul, he details CVE-2024-2887 – a type confusion bug that occurs in both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (Chromium). He used this bug as a part of his winning exploit that led to code execution in the renderer of both browsers. This bug was quickly patched by both </em><a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_26.html"><em>Google</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-2887"><em>Microsoft</em></a><em>. Manfred has graciously provided this detailed write-up of the vulnerability and how he exploited it at the contest.</em></p>





















  
  



<hr /><p>In this blog, I describe a means of exploiting the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine to gain execution of arbitrary shellcode inside the renderer process. This includes a bypass of the V8 memory sandbox (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM4fQmIhEqPG8uGp5o9A-mnPB5BOeScZYpkHjo0KKA8/edit#heading=h.xzptrog8pyxf">Ubercage</a>), though code execution is still constrained by the process isolation-based browser sandbox. For demonstration purposes, this limitation can be removed by running the browser with the <code>--no- sandbox</code> flag. </p>
<p><b>Root Cause of the WebAssembly Universal Type Confusion</b></p>
<p>A WebAssembly module may contain a <code>type</code> section that defines a list of custom “heap types”. In the base specification, this is used only to declare function types, but with the adoption of the garbage collection (GC) <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/gc/core/_download/WebAssembly.pdf">proposal</a> [PDF], this section can additionally define struct types, allowing for the use of composite, heap-allocated types in WebAssembly. </p>
<p>Normally, a struct declared in this section may only reference structs that precede it  (structs with a lower type index). To support mutually recursive data structures, a feature called recursive type groups is available. Instead of declaring the (potentially) mutually recursive types as individual entries in the type section, a recursive group is declared as a single type section entry. Within this group, individual types are declared, which are thereby allowed to reference each other.</p>
<p>With this in mind, consider the function responsible for parsing the <code>type</code> section from the binary WebAssembly format in <code>v8/src/wasm/module-decoder-impl.h</code>: </p>

<p>At (1), the limit <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> (currently equal to 1,000,000) is passed as a maximum to <code>consume_count()</code>, ensuring that at most this many entries are read from the <code>type</code> section. When recursive type groups were added, this check became insufficient. While this code will permit only <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> entries of the <code>type</code> section to be read, each of those can potentially be a recursive type group containing more than one individual type definition. </p>
<p>This insufficiency was clearly noticed at the time of this change, as together with recursive type groups a second check was added at (2). Here, for each recursive type group, it is checked that the addition of the constituent types would not exceed the <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> limit. </p>
<p>However, this second check is still not enough. While it protects the indices of each type allocated inside a recursive group, the presence of those groups also has implications for types declared outside this group, as each recursive group adds to the total count of declared types. </p>
<p>To make this clearer, imagine a type section consisting of two entries: one recursive group containing<code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> entries, and following that group, one non-recursive type. The check at (1) is passed, as the section only has two entries. While processing the recursive group, the check at (2) is also passed, as the section has exactly <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> entries. For the following single type, there is no further check: at (3) the type is simply allocated at the next free index. In this case, the index will be  <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code>, exceeding the usual maximum of <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes-1</code>. If there were more than one non-recursive type at the end of the <code>type</code> section, they would similarly get assigned <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes+1</code>, <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes+2</code>, and so forth, as type indices. </p>
<p><b>Impact of the Root Cause</b></p>
<p>Exceeding the maximal number of declared heap types might seem like a very harmless resource exhaustion bug at first. However, due to some internal details of how V8 handles WebAssembly heap types, it directly allows constructing some very powerful exploit primitives. </p>
<p>In <code>v8/src/wasm/value-type.h</code>, the encoding of heap types is defined: </p>

<p>Here, V8 assumes that all user-defined heap types will be assigned indices smaller than <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code>. Larger indices are reserved for fixed, internal heap types (beginning with <code>kFunc</code>). This results in our own type declarations aliasing one of these internal types, leading to many opportunities for type confusion. </p>
<p><b>Universal WebAssembly Type Confusion</b></p>
<p>To leverage this encoding ambiguity into a full type confusion, let’s first consider the <code>struct.new</code> opcode, which produces a reference to a new struct created from fields given on the stack. The caller specifies the desired struct type by passing its type index. The relevant check on the type index can be found in <code>v8/src/wasm/function-body-decoder-impl.h</code>:</p>

<p>Following the validation logic into the <code>has_struct()</code> method from <code>v8/src/wasm/wasm-module.h</code>: </p>

<p>Since we can make <code>types.size()</code>  exceed the usual limit of <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code>, we can make the check pass even if when passing an index larger than this value. This allows us to create a reference of an arbitrary internal type that points to the struct we can freely define. </p>
<p>On the other hand, consider now the handling of the <code>ref.cast</code> instruction: </p>

<p>Here, a <code>type</code> check elimination is performed. If <code>TypeCheckAlwaysSucceeds</code> returns true, then no actual <code>type</code> check is emitted and the value is simply reinterpreted as the target <code>type</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>TypeCheckAlwaysSucceeds</code> ultimately calls <code>IsHeapSubtypeOfImpl</code> defined in <code>v8/src/wasm/wasm-subtyping.cc</code>:</p>

<p>This means that if our declared type index aliases the constant <code>HeapType::kNone</code>, the type check will always be elided if we cast to any non-function, non-external reference. In combination, we can use this to turn any reference type into any other by the following steps: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>   In the type section, define a structure type with a single field of type <code>anyref</code>, and make this struct have a type index equal to <code>HeapType::kNone</code> using the bug described above. </p>
</li>
<li><p>   Place a non-null reference value of any type on the top of the stack and call <code>struct.new</code> with the type index set to <code>HeapType::kNone</code>. This will succeed, as <code>has_struct()</code> validates the index against the index established via the previous step. </p>
</li>
<li><p>   Also, declare a struct with a normal type index lower than <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> with a single field of the target reference type. Call <code>ref.cast</code> with this  this struct’s type index. The engine will not perform any type check, as the input value is at this point understood to be reference type <code>HeapType::kNone</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>   Finally, read back the reference stored in the struct by executing <code>struct.get</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This arbitrary casting of reference types allows transmuting any value type into any other by referencing it, changing the reference type, and then dereferencing it – a universal type confusion. </p>
<p>In particular, this directly contains nearly all usual JavaScript engine exploitation primitives as special cases:</p>
<p>•	Transmuting <code>int</code> to <code>int*</code> and then dereferencing results in an arbitrary read.</p>
<p>•	Transmuting <code>int</code> to <code>int*</code> and then writing to that reference results in an arbitrary write.</p>
<p>•	Transmuting <code>externref</code>to <code>int</code> is the <code>addrOf()</code> primitive, obtaining the address of a JavaScript object.</p>
<p>•	Transmuting <code>int</code> to <code>externref</code> is the <code>fakeObj()</code> primitive, forcing the engine to treat an arbitrary value as a pointer to a JavaScript object. </p>
<p>While casting from <code>HeapType::kNone</code> to an <code>externref</code> is not allowed, remember that we are actually operating on one more level of indirection - transmuting to <code>externref</code> involves casting to a reference to a struct containing one <code>externref</code> member.</p>
<p>Note however that these “arbitrary” reads and writes are still contained in the V8 memory sandbox, as all involved pointers to heap-allocated structures are tagged, compressed pointers inside the heap cage, not full 64-bit raw pointers. </p>
<p><b>Integer Underflow Leading to V8 Sandbox Escape</b> </p>
<p>The primitives described above allow for freely manipulating and faking most JavaScript objects. However, all of this happens inside the limited memory space of the V8 sandbox. “Trusted” objects such as WebAssembly instance data cannot yet be manipulated. We will now turn our attention to a bug that can be used to escape the memory sandbox.</p>
<p>An often-used object for JavaScript engine exploits is <code>ArrayBuffer</code> and its corresponding views, (i.e. typed arrays), as it allows for direct, untagged access to some region of memory. </p>
<p>To prevent access to pointers outside the V8 sandbox, sandboxed pointers are used to designate a typed array’s corresponding backing store. Similarly, an ArrayBuffer’s length field is always loaded as a “bounded size access”, inherently limiting its value to a maximum of 235 − 1. </p>
<p>However, in modern JavaScript, the handling of typed arrays has become quite complex due to the introduction of resizable ArrayBuffers (RABs) and their sharable variant, growable SharedArrayBuffers (GSABs). Both variants feature the ability to change their length after the object has been created with the shared variant being restricted to never shrink. In particular, for typed arrays with these kinds of buffers, the array length can never be cached and must be recomputed on each access.</p>
<p>Additionally, ArrayBuffers also feature an offset field, describing the start of the data in the 
actual underlying backing store. This offset must be taken into account when computing the length. </p>
<p>Let’s now look at the code responsible for building a TypedArray’s length access in the optimizing Turbofan compiler. It can be found in <code>v8/src/compiler/graph-assembler.cc</code>. Note that most non-RAB/GSAB cases and the code responsible for dispatching are omitted for simplicity: </p>

<p>For arrays backed by a resizable ArrayBuffer, we can see at (1) that the length is computed as <code>floor((byte_length - byte_offset) / element_size)</code>. Crucially, there is an underflow check. If <code>byte_offset</code> exceeds <code>byte_length</code>, then 0 is returned instead. </p>
<p>Curiously though, in the case of a GSAB-backed array, the corresponding underflow check is missing. Thus, if <code>byte_offset</code> is larger than <code>byte_length</code>, an underflow occurs and the subtraction wraps around to something close to the maximum unsigned 64-bit integer 264. As both of these fields are found in the (by now) attacker-controlled array object, we can easily trigger this using the sandboxed arbitrary read/write primitives discussed previously. This results in access to the whole 64-bit address space, as the length computed by this function is used to bound any typed array accesses (in JIT-compiled code). </p>
<p><b>Exploitation for Arbitrary Shellcode Execution</b></p>
<p>Using the two bugs described above, exploitation becomes fairly straightforward. The primitives described in the Universal WebAssembly Type Confusion section directly give arbitrary reads and writes within the V8 memory sandbox. This can then be used to manipulate a growable <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> to have an offset greater than its length. A previously JIT-compiled read/write function can then be used to access and overwrite data anywhere in the process’s address space. An appropriate target for overwrite is the compiled code of a <code>WebAssembly</code> module, since that resides in an RWX (read-write-execute) page and can be overwritten with shellcode.</p>

<title>Crooks Bypassed Google’s Email Verification to Create Workspace Accounts, Access 3rd-Party Services</title>

<guid>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/crooks-bypassed-googles-email-verification-to-create-workspace-accounts-access-3rd-party-services/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Google</strong> says it recently fixed an authentication weakness that allowed crooks to circumvent the email verification required to create a <strong>Google Workspace</strong> account, and leverage that to impersonate a domain holder at third-party services that allow logins through Google&#8217;s &#8220;Sign in with Google&#8221; feature.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68194" height="367" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/signinwithgoogle.png" width="418" /></p>
<p>Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,&#8221; the notice from Google read. &#8220;These EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using &#8216;Sign In with Google&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Anu Yamunan</strong>, director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved &#8220;a few thousand&#8221; Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified.</p>
<p>Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,&#8221; Yamunan said. &#8220;The vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online.</p>
<p>In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at <strong>Dropbox</strong>.</p>
<p>Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/researchers-weak-security-defaults-enabled-squarespace-domains-hijacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace</a>, which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains.</p>
<p>On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn&#8217;t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published <a href="https://status.squarespace.com/incidents/cw2wf55bps15" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a statement</a> blaming the domain hijacks on “a weakness related to OAuth logins”, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A Google Cloud Storage bucket leak has brought renewed attention to the risk of misconfigured cloud storage buckets, one of the most common cloud security issues and causes of data leaks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Alice’s Table, a former contestant on ABC’s Shark Tank, apparently inadvertently leaked more than <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/google-cloud-leak-alices-table/">37,000 files</a> from a misconfigured Google Cloud Storage bucket, including personally identifiable information (PII) of more than 83,000 customers, such as full names, email addresses, and home addresses.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some of the accounts were associated with organizations, ranging from Pfizer, PwC, and Charles Schwab to government accounts. The information could be used for malicious purposes, such as phishing and identity theft.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The leak underscores the importance of cloud storage bucket access control, and regularly auditing permissions and monitoring for data leaks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cloud storage bucket misconfigurations are surprisingly common – Cyble's <a href="https://search.odin.io/exposed-buckets?query=provider%253A%2522gcp%2522">Odin vulnerability search tool</a> is currently detecting more than 332,000 exposed AWS storage buckets and more than 168,000 Google Cloud Storage exposures.</p>

<p>We look at best practices and options for cloud storage access management – and ways to detect unintended or malicious access.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cloud Storage Bucket Access and Configuration Best Practices</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We don’t know exactly what went wrong in the Alice’s Table data exposure, but managing access to cloud storage buckets is a tricky practice that even the largest organizations can get wrong. We’ll look at access control options for cloud storage buckets in Google Cloud, how to make a bucket or objects readable to the public as securely as possible, and options for monitoring and detecting exposed buckets and data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Restrict Storage Bucket Access By Default</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The best way to secure a Google Cloud Storage bucket is to not make it public in the first place. Access to Cloud Storage buckets is restricted by default, but there may be legitimate reasons why users would want to make a bucket public.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google Cloud Storage offers two means for controlling access to storage buckets: Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Access Control Lists (ACL). IAM is the preferred method for securing buckets, but ACLs can be used to configure access for specific objects in a bucket.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google recommends <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access">uniform bucket-level access</a>, which disables ACLs and makes IAM the exclusive means for access control. The more fine-grained approach of using IAM and ACLs together poses a great risk of exposing data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-access-prevention">Public access prevention</a> is perhaps the strongest level of control, as it overrides IAM and ACL.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Making a Cloud Storage Bucket Readable to the Public</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To make all objects in a bucket readable to everyone on the public internet, you can &nbsp;grant the principal <em>allUsers</em> the Storage Object Viewer (<em>roles/storage.objectViewer</em>) role, which includes the permission required to list the objects in the bucket, but a safer approach is to grant the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles#legacy-roles">Storage Legacy Object Reader</a> role (<em>roles/storage.legacyObjectReader</em>) so users can access objects without listing them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another way to balance access and risk is to use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managed-folders">managed folders</a>, which allow fine-grained access to specific groups of objects with a bucket.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Detecting Exposed Cloud Storage Buckets</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There’s no easy way to detect exposed cloud storage buckets (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-logs">usage logs</a> are one possible option), so routine audits of bucket access permissions – and potentially removing permissions for <em>allUsers</em> and <em>allAuthenticatedUsers</em> – is a critically important practice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Data loss prevention (DLP) tools can help you identify where you have sensitive data stored that needs to be protected, and cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools can help you identify configuration issues.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Other important cloud storage security and compliance practices include object versioning, object encryption, and retention and lifecycle management.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble Odin can help organizations detect exposed cloud storage buckets, and dark web monitoring tools such as those from <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/dark-web-monitoring/">Cyble</a> can give organizations an early warning when leaks do occur so they can respond faster and take action to secure accounts and data.</p>
