Qilin, active since at least 2022, is already notorious for its "double extortion" strategy. This method involves encrypting the victim’s data while simultaneously threatening to leak or sell the data unless a ransom is paid.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The discovery of Qilin's latest tactic underscores the evolution of ransomware attacks into more sophisticated and damaging operations.

The breach came to light following an attack on Synnovis, a UK governmental healthcare service provider.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The attack began with the exploitation of compromised credentials to access the organization’s VPN portal, which lacked multi-factor authentication (MFA), allowing the attackers initial access. Once inside, the attackers spent 18 days conducting surveillance before moving laterally to a domain controller.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Here, they modified the Group Policy Objects (GPO) to implement a malicious PowerShell script named `IPScanner.ps1`. This script was designed to harvest login credentials stored in Google Chrome browsers and was automatically executed every time users logged into their devices.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The stolen credentials were stored in the SYSVOL share, labeled by the infected device's hostname, and subsequently exfiltrated to the attackers' command-and-control server. To avoid detection, the attackers cleared event logs and deleted the local data copies before deploying the ransomware.

Given that Google Chrome holds over 65 per cent of the browser market share, the attackers were able to access a large array of usernames and passwords stored by users, raising the scale of the breach.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This method of credential harvesting introduces a new layer of threat, potentially allowing Qilin to access multiple high-value targets, complicating response efforts for organizations.

Affected organizations have been urged to reset all Active Directory passwords and advise users to change the passwords of any sites saved in Chrome.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This tactic may serve as a "bonus multiplier" for attackers, increasing the chaos inherent in ransomware situations by gaining insights into high-value accounts, making future attacks even more damaging.

This breach highlights a growing concern over organizations' abilities to defend against such multifaceted and evolving ransomware threats</div>

An investigation by Microsoft has revealed that a North Korean threat actor exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Chromium browser that has been tracked as CVE-2024-7971 to conduct a sophisticated cyber operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to the report, Citrine Sleet, the notorious group behind the attack that targets cryptography sectors in particular, is responsible for the attack.

It has been reported that CVE-2024-7971 is a type of confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that had been impacted in versions of Chrome before 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, threat actors could gain remote code execution (RCE) access to the sandboxed Chromium renderer process and conduct a remote attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There was a vulnerability that was fixed by Google on August 21, 2024, and users should ensure that they are running the most recent version of Chrome.

It is clear from this development that the nation-state adversary is trying to increase its penetration of Windows zero-day exploits in recent months, indicating that they are persistent in their efforts to acquire and introduce oodles of zero-day exploits.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Microsoft security researcher found evidence that Citrine Sleet (formerly DEV-0139 and DEV-1222) was responsible for the activity. Citrine Sleet is also known as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, Nickel Academy, and UNC4736, all of which are associated with Citrine Sleet. There is an assessment that this sub-cluster is part of the Lazarus Group (a.k.a. Diamond Sleet and Hidden Cobra) which is related to Lazarus.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Several analysts have previously credited the use of AppleJeus malware to a Lazarus subgroup called BlueNoroff (also known as APT38, Nickel Gladstone, and Stardust Chollima), indicating the fact that the threat actors share both toolsets and infrastructure from one subgroup to another.

Some cybersecurity vendors maintain track of this North Korean threat group under different names, such as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, and UNC4736, among others.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Hidden Cobra is a term used by the U.S. government to describe malicious actors sponsored by the North Korean government collectively as being influenced by the state. It is mostly targeted at financial institutions, with a special focus on cryptocurrency organizations and individuals who are closely associated with the cryptocurrency industry.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the past, it has been linked to Bureau 121 of the Reconnaissance General Bureau of North Korea, where it practices intelligence gathering.

Moreover, North Korean hackers are also known for using malicious websites that appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to infect prospective victims with fake job applications, weaponized cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading apps designed to steal sensitive information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is the first time UNC4736 malware has been identified in a supply chain attack, for example in March 2023 it attacked the Electron-based desktop client of video conferencing software provider 3CX. Further, they were able to breach the website of Trading Technologies, an automation company for stock market trading, to sneakily push trojanized versions of the X_TRADER software into the system.

In a March 2022 report, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) also linked AppleJeus to the compromise of Trading Technologies' website, highlighting AppleJeus as being behind the attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For years, the U.S. government has repeatedly issued warnings about state-sponsored cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency-related businesses and individuals with AppleJeus malware that is backed by the North Korean government. As a result of the security vulnerability CVE-2024-7971 that was discovered last week, Google patched Chrome's version 8 JavaScript engine and reported it as a type confusion vulnerability.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In a recent cybersecurity incident report, it was revealed that victims were directed to a domain controlled by the threat group Citrine Sleet, identified as voyagorclub[.]space. The exact method by which victims were lured to this domain remains undetermined, though it is suspected that social engineering tactics were employed. This is consistent with Citrine Sleet’s established modus operandi, which frequently involves manipulating individuals through social engineering to initiate attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon successful redirection to the malicious domain, attackers leveraged a zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-7971. This vulnerability is linked to a type of confusion flaw in Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Google addressed this security issue in a recent patch, highlighting that it allowed attackers to achieve RCE within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process of the victim's browser. Once inside this sandboxed environment, the attackers further escalated their access by exploiting a secondary vulnerability in the Windows kernel.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The additional vulnerability, CVE-2024-38106, was exploited to escape the browser’s sandbox environment. This kernel vulnerability, which Microsoft had patched in their latest Patch Tuesday release, allowed attackers to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the compromised system. Following this, the attackers downloaded and activated a highly sophisticated rootkit known as FudModule. This malware, when loaded into memory, enabled direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM), providing attackers with the capability to bypass critical kernel security measures.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The FudModule rootkit is particularly concerning, as it is designed to manipulate kernel-level processes, enabling attackers to establish persistent backdoor access to the compromised system. Through DKOM, the rootkit effectively tampers with core system functions, allowing attackers to evade detection, steal sensitive information, and potentially deploy additional malicious software.

Interestingly, the FudModule rootkit has been linked to another North Korean state-sponsored group known as Diamond Sleet, which has utilized this malware since its discovery in October 2022.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This suggests a potential collaboration between Citrine Sleet and Diamond Sleet or, at the very least, shared access to malicious tools and infrastructure. Furthermore, the rootkit bears similarities to tools used by another notorious hacking group, the Lazarus Group, indicating that FudModule may be part of a broader North Korean cyber-espionage toolkit.

Citrine Sleet's attack demonstrates a highly coordinated and multi-faceted approach, beginning with social engineering techniques to lure victims to a compromised domain and culminating in the exploitation of critical vulnerabilities to gain deep control over target systems.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By leveraging both CVE-2024-7971 and CVE-2024-38106, the attackers were able to bypass multiple layers of security, from browser sandboxing to Windows kernel defences.

Microsoft has issued a series of recommendations to help organizations mitigate the risk of such attacks. They stress the importance of maintaining up-to-date software and operating systems, as timely patching is critical to closing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Microsoft advocates for the deployment of security solutions that provide unified visibility across the entire cyberattack chain. Such tools can detect and block attacker tools and post-compromise malicious activity. Lastly, strengthening the configuration of the operating environment is recommended to minimize the likelihood of successful exploitation and post-compromise activity. 

This incident underscores the evolving nature of cyber threats and highlights the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures to detect, block, and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs).</div>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Citrine Sleet threat actor group was observed by Microsoft researchers exploiting the CVE-2024-7971 zero-day vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which affects versions of Chromium prior to 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attackers achieved remote code execution (RCE) within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process. Google has since released a patch for the vulnerability, on August 21, 2024, and users are advised to update to the latest version of Chromium to mitigate the risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;Technical Analysis&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The observed attack chain involved a typical browser exploit sequence, starting with targets being directed to a Citrine Sleet-controlled exploit domain, voyagorclub[.]space, through common social engineering tactics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the users were connected, the zero-day RCE exploit for CVE-2024-7971 was deployed, allowing the attackers to download and load shellcode containing a Windows sandbox escape exploit and the FudModule rootkit into memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>FudModule is an advanced rootkit <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">malware</a> designed to target kernel access while avoiding detection. Threat actors have been seen using the FudModule data-only rootkit to gain admin-to-kernel access on Windows-based systems, enabling read/write primitive operations and conducting Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attack chain seen in Citrine Sleet's zero-day exploit of CVE-2024-7971 closely mirrors the chain observed by Avast, which involves a variant of FudModule known as "FudModule 2.0." This variant includes malicious loaders and a late-stage remote access trojan (RAT). The research identified the previously unknown Kaolin RAT as the malware responsible for deploying the FudModule rootkit on targeted devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion and Recommendations&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>CVE-2024-7971 is the third vulnerability this year that North Korean threat actors have exploited to deploy the FudModule rootkit, following CVE-2024-21338 and CVE-2024-38193. To address zero-day exploits effectively, it is crucial not only to keep systems updated but also to use security solutions that offer comprehensive visibility across the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cyberattack</a> chain to detect and block attacker tools and malicious activities after exploitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Citrine Sleet threat actor group was observed by Microsoft researchers exploiting the CVE-2024-7971 zero-day vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which affects versions of Chromium prior to 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attackers achieved remote code execution (RCE) within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process. Google has since released a patch for the vulnerability, on August 21, 2024, and users are advised to update to the latest version of Chromium to mitigate the risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;Technical Analysis&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The observed attack chain involved a typical browser exploit sequence, starting with targets being directed to a Citrine Sleet-controlled exploit domain, voyagorclub[.]space, through common social engineering tactics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the users were connected, the zero-day RCE exploit for CVE-2024-7971 was deployed, allowing the attackers to download and load shellcode containing a Windows sandbox escape exploit and the FudModule rootkit into memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>FudModule is an advanced rootkit <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">malware</a> designed to target kernel access while avoiding detection. Threat actors have been seen using the FudModule data-only rootkit to gain admin-to-kernel access on Windows-based systems, enabling read/write primitive operations and conducting Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attack chain seen in Citrine Sleet's zero-day exploit of CVE-2024-7971 closely mirrors the chain observed by Avast, which involves a variant of FudModule known as "FudModule 2.0." This variant includes malicious loaders and a late-stage remote access trojan (RAT). The research identified the previously unknown Kaolin RAT as the malware responsible for deploying the FudModule rootkit on targeted devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion and Recommendations&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>CVE-2024-7971 is the third vulnerability this year that North Korean threat actors have exploited to deploy the FudModule rootkit, following CVE-2024-21338 and CVE-2024-38193. To address zero-day exploits effectively, it is crucial not only to keep systems updated but also to use security solutions that offer comprehensive visibility across the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cyberattack</a> chain to detect and block attacker tools and malicious activities after exploitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To mitigate the risks posed by Citrine Sleet and similar threats, the following best practices are recommended:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Activate the automatic software update function on your computer, mobile device, and any other linked devices when feasible and practical. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Employ a trusted antivirus solution and internet security software suite on all connected devices, such as your PC, laptop, and mobile phone. </li>

<title>Sextortion Scams Now Include Photos of Your Home</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/sextortion-scams-now-include-photos-of-your-home/</link>
<guid>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/sextortion-scams-now-include-photos-of-your-home/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An old but persistent email scam known as &#8220;<strong>sextortion</strong>&#8221; has a new personalized touch: The missives, which claim that malware has captured webcam footage of recipients pleasuring themselves, now include a photo of the target&#8217;s home in a bid to make threats about publishing the videos more frightening and convincing.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-44412" height="134" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sextortion.png" width="750" /></p>
<p>This week, several readers reported receiving sextortion emails that addressed them by name and included images of their street or front yard that were apparently lifted from an online mapping application such as <strong>Google Maps</strong>.</p>
<p>The message purports to have been sent from a hacker who’s compromised your computer and used your webcam to record a video of you while you were watching porn. The missive threatens to release the video to all of your contacts unless you pay a Bitcoin ransom. In this case, the demand is just shy of $2,000, payable by scanning a QR code embedded in the email.</p>
<p>Following a salutation that includes the recipient&#8217;s full name, the start of the message reads, &#8220;Is visiting [recipient&#8217;s street address] a more convenient way to contact if you don&#8217;t take action. Nice location btw.&#8221; Below that is the photo of the recipient&#8217;s street address.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_68587" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-68587" height="677" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sextortion-maps.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-68587">A semi-redacted screenshot of a newish sextortion scam that includes a photo of the target&#8217;s front yard.</p></div>
<p>The message tells people they have 24 hours to pay up, or else their embarrassing videos will be released to all of their contacts, friends and family members.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t even think about replying to this, it&#8217;s pointless,&#8221; the message concludes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t make mistakes, [recipient&#8217;s name]. If I notice that you&#8217;ve shared or discussed this email with someone else, your shitty video will instantly start getting sent to your contacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remaining sections of the two-page sextortion message (which arrives as a PDF attachment) are fairly formulaic and include thematic elements seen in most previous sextortion waves. Those include claims that the extortionist has installed malware on your computer (in this case the scammer claims the spyware is called &#8220;Pegasus,&#8221; and that they are watching everything you do on your machine).</p>
<p>Previous innovations in sextortion customization involved sending emails that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/sextortion-scam-uses-recipients-hacked-passwords/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">included at least one password they had previously used</a> at an account online that was tied to their email address. <span id="more-68585"></span></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>Sextortion — even semi-automated scams like this one with no actual physical leverage to backstop the extortion demand — is a serious crime that can lead to devastating consequences for victims. Sextortion occurs when someone threatens to distribute your private and sensitive material if you don’t provide them with images of a sexual nature, sexual favors, or money.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, here are some things you can do to avoid becoming a victim:</p>
<p>-Never send compromising images of yourself to anyone, no matter who they are — or who they say they are.<br />
-Don’t open attachments from people you don’t know, and be wary of opening attachments even from those you do know.<br />
-Turn off [and/or cover] any web cameras when you are not using them.</p>
<p>The FBI says in many sextortion cases, the perpetrator is an adult pretending to be a teenager, and you are just one of the many victims being targeted by the same person. If you believe you’re a victim of sextortion, or know someone else who is, the FBI wants to hear from you: Contact your local FBI office (or toll-free at 1-800-CALL-FBI).</p>

<guid>https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-google-chrome-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution_2024-094</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

By using phishing tactics, hackers are targeting users' passwords for Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon through phishing campaigns that pose significant risks to their personal information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A new notice has appeared warning users of Google Mail, Facebook, and Amazon that there has been a new attack on password hacking that puts their personal information at risk because society has gone digital and protecting your credentials is "the name of the game." 

There is no denying the fact that these platforms are among the most popular in the world, so it is vital to have a good understanding of what threats are coming and what possibilities there are to prevent these threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Overall, cybersecurity experts predict a steady increase for the year, but they also note that the complexity of password hacks for Gmail and Facebook, as well as attempts to access Amazon accounts, has grown dramatically as well. It has been found that the complexity of password hacks for Gmail and Facebook has increased dramatically as a result of increased complexity in the attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Typically, these hacking attempts benefit from phishing attacks, brute force attacks, and social engineering attacks, all of which are designed to take advantage of overly trustful users or weaknesses within the platforms that make them vulnerable.

Several new threat analyses, including those conducted by Kaspersky Labs, reveal that password theft attacks have become increasingly common against Amazon users, Facebook users, and, most of all, Google users. 

There have been several attacks targeting these platforms, including those aimed at stealing passwords.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Kaspersky reported an increase of 40% in attempts of hackers to entice users to access malicious sites impersonating these brands in comparison to last year based on a study it conducted.

It is no surprise that malicious hackers are seeking credentials for Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon accounts to spread their malicious programming. As a matter of fact, these accounts may be exploited to reach the full heights of cybercrime by committing data theft, malware distribution, and credit card fraud all at the same time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Google account is a skeleton key that can be used to unlock an entire treasure trove of other account credentials, as well as personal information, enabling fraudsters to access a treasure trove of private information. The information contained in a user's Gmail inbox is immeasurable when compared to that contained in their inbox on the web, and the chances are that they will have one given how popular this web-based free email service is with most people these days. 

As per Kaspersky reports, hackers are mainly targeting Google, Amazon, and Facebook passwords in their effort to steal personal information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the first half of 2024, Kaspersky Security reported a 243% increase in the number of attack attempts, with the company itself preventing approximately 4 million attempts. It is estimated that Facebook users were exposed to 3.7 million phishing attempts during the same period, and Amazon users were exposed to 3 million.&nbsp;

In an interview with Kaspersky Internet Security, Olga Svistunova, who is an expert in data security at the company, warned that a criminal with access to a Gmail account may be able to access "multiple services".&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, it is important to note that not only may business information be leaked as a result, but also the personal information of customers can also be leaked as a result.

To target these platforms, hackers are looking for account passwords, as getting access to these platforms allows them to commit fraud, distribute malware, and steal sensitive information. It is proposed that Google accounts are especially valuable since they can be used to hack into other accounts and to collect personal information that can be used in fraud attempts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to researchers at GuidePoint Research and Intelligence Team, Rui Ataide and Hermes Bojaxhi of the GuidePoint Research and Intelligence Team, there is an ongoing phishing campaign targeting more than 130 U.S. organizations, which has been detected as a new and worrying one. There have been so many misuses of the term "highly sophisticated threat actor" in recent years that it almost has lost all meaning, but the tactics and intrusion capabilities that were employed by this as-yet-unnamed attacker have led the GRIT researchers to conclude that this attacker deserves to be called such a label.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A spear-phishing attack, as with other spear-phishing campaigns, revolves around the targeting of specific employees within an organization rather than attempting to hit every single email account in an organization with a scattergun approach, as is so often the case with so-called spear-phishing campaigns.

The attack has also targeted other tech giants, including Microsoft and Apple, as well as numerous smaller companies. Additionally, DHL, Mastercard, Netflix, eBay, and HSBC are also among the companies involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cloud security provider Netskope, in a recent report, found a 2,000-fold increase in traffic to phishing pages sent through Microsoft Sway, a cloud-based application that provides users with the ability to create visual instructions, newsletters, and presentations through the use of visual illustrations.

Hackers are increasingly exploiting a technique known as “quishing,” a form of phishing that utilizes QR codes to deceive users into logging into malicious websites, thereby stealing their passwords. This method is particularly effective as QR codes can bypass email scanners designed to detect text-based threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, since QR codes are frequently scanned with mobile devices—which often lack the robust security measures found on desktops and laptops—users become more vulnerable to these types of attacks.

A new variant of QR code phishing has been recently detailed by J. Stephen Kowski, the Field Chief Technology Officer at SlashNext, in a LinkedIn article. Unlike traditional QR code phishing, which typically involves an image-based QR code redirecting users to a malicious site, this new method leverages Unicode text characters to create QR codes.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Kowski, this approach presents three significant challenges for defenders: it evades image-based analysis, ensures accurate screen rendering, and creates a duality in appearance between the screen rendering and plain text, making detection more difficult.

Given these emerging threats, individuals who frequently use platforms such as Google’s Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon, as well as other major online services, should exercise caution to avoid becoming victims of identity theft. The risk of falling prey to password-hacking attempts can be significantly reduced by adhering to best practices in security hygiene across different accounts and maintaining a high level of vigilance.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In today’s technology-driven world, personal awareness and proactive measures serve as the first line of defence against such cyber threats.



Protecting Business Accounts from Phishing Attacks&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Recognize Phishing Indicators</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">- Generic Domain Extensions: Be cautious of emails from generic domains like "@gmail.com" instead of corporate domains, as attackers use these to impersonate businesses.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Misspelt Domains: </b>Watch for near-identical domains that slightly alter legitimate ones, such as "Faceb0ok.com." These deceptive domains are used to trick users into providing sensitive information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Content Quality:</b> Legitimate communications are typically polished and professional. Spelling errors, poor grammar, and unprofessional formatting are red flags of phishing attempts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Urgency and Fear Tactics:</b> Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency, pressuring recipients to act quickly to avoid negative consequences, such as account suspensions or security breaches.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Unusual Requests:</b> Be wary of unexpected requests for money, personal information, or prompts to click links or download attachments. Hackers often impersonate trusted entities to deceive recipients.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Implement Security Software&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">-<b> Install robust security tools,</b> including firewalls, spam filters, and antivirus software, to guard against phishing attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">- <b>Utilize web filters</b> to restrict access to malicious websites.

   - Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities and protect against new threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Enhance account security</b> by implementing MFA, which requires a second verification factor (e.g., a code, fingerprint, or secret question) in addition to a password.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- MFA significantly</b> reduces the risk of unauthorized access and helps safeguard business credentials.

By staying vigilant, maintaining updated security software, and utilizing MFA, businesses can better protect their accounts and sensitive information from phishing attacks.</div>

Cybercriminals are believed to have named the malware "Voldemort" based on the internal file names and strings used in it.&nbsp;

As part of the attack chain, multiple tactics have been employed, some of which are currently popular in the threat landscape, while others are less common, such as using Google Sheets as a program for command and control (C2).&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is noteworthy that in addition to tactical, technical, and procedural (TTPs) components, it takes advantage of a lure theme impersonating the government agencies of a variety of countries, and it uses odd file naming and passwords such as "test". Several researchers initially suspected that the activity may be a red team, but analysis of the malware and the number of messages indicated that it was a threat actor very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There has been an aggressive malware campaign known as "Voldemort" launched against organizations all over the world, impersonating tax authorities in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. Since the malicious activity was launched on Aug. 5, more than 20,000 phishing messages were reported worldwide by dozens of companies. According to Proofpoint, over 20,000 phishing messages were reported during the last three months.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A custom backdoor has been written in C and was designed to enable data exfiltration and the deployment of additional malicious payloads, as well as the exfiltration of data itself. 

The exploit is based on an exploit that takes advantage of a browser extension called 'Google Sheets' to be used as the C2 communication tool for the attack, and files that are infected with a malicious Windows search protocol are used to carry out the attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As soon as the victim downloads the malware, it uses WebEx software to load a DLL that communicates with the C2 server using a legitimate version of WebEx software.

There are several attack chains outlined in this attack chain, which include a variety of techniques currently common in the threat landscape, as well as a variety of rarely used methods of command and control (C2) such as the use of Google Sheets.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) have been applied to it in combination with lure themes impersonating government agencies of various countries as well as its strange file naming and passwords, such as "test". Initial suspicions were that this activity might have been the work of a red team, but the large volume of messages and an analysis of the malware indicated that it was the work of a threat actor very quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Proofpoint's assessment, there is a moderate amount of confidence that this is likely the actions of an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor that is seeking to gather intelligence. Although Proofpoint is well-versed in identifying named threat actors, it is still not confident enough with the data available to attribute a specific TA with high certainty. There is no doubt that some aspects of the malware, such as the widespread targeting and characteristics, are associated more often with cybercrime activity, but the nature of the malware does not appear to be motivated by financial gain at this time, but more by espionage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Powered by C, Voldemort is a custom backdoor that was written to gather information. As well as the capability to gather information, it also can drop additional payloads on the target. As Proofpoint discovered, Cobalt Strike was being hosted on the actor's infrastructure, and that would likely be one of the payloads that is being delivered by the actor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

There was a significant increase in phishing emails sent daily by the hackers beginning on August 17, when nearly 6,000 emails appeared to be impersonating tax agencies, which was high, according to the researchers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, the HM Revenue &amp; Customs in the United Kingdom, and the Direction Générale des Finances Publiques in France joined the list of potential regulators. A layer of credibility was added to the lures by crafting the phishing email in the native language of the respective tax authority, adding a high degree of legitimacy to the message.

As part of their authenticity, the emails received from what appeared to be compromised domains contained the legitimate domain names of the tax agencies, to make them appear more genuine.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is no definitive answer to the overall objective of the campaign, though Proofpoint researchers say it seems likely that the campaign is aimed at espionage, given Voldemort's intelligence-gathering capacities as well as his ability to deploy additional payloads into the mainstream.



There are more than half of all targeted organizations fall into the sectors of insurance, aerospace, transportation, and education.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The threat actor behind this campaign is unknown, but Proofpoint believes that it may be engaged in cyber espionage operations as a means of obtaining information.



Likewise, the messages also contain Google AMP Cache URLs that redirect to the landing page on InfinityFree, as well as a direct link to the landing page, which is included in the campaign later on. Towards the bottom of the landing page, there is a button that says "Click to view the document", which when clicked, checks the User Agent or software in the browser.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When the User Agent contains "Windows," the browser is automatically redirected to a search-ms URI, which points to a TryCloudflare-tunneled URI ending in .search-ms. This redirection prompts the victim to open Windows Explorer, although the specific query responsible for this action remains hidden from the victim, leaving only a popup visible. Concurrently, an image is loaded from a URL ending in /stage1 on an IP address that is managed by the logging service pingb.in. This service enables the threat actor to record a successful redirect and collect additional browser and network information about the victim.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A distinguishing feature of the Voldemort malware is its use of Google Sheets as a command and control (C2) server. The malware pings Google Sheets to retrieve new commands to execute on the compromised device and to serve as a repository for exfiltrated data. Each infected machine writes its data to specific cells within the Google Sheet, which are often designated by unique identifiers, such as UUIDs. This method ensures that data from different breached systems remains isolated, allowing for more efficient management.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Voldemort interacts with Google Sheets using Google's API, relying on an embedded client ID, secret, and refresh token, all of which are stored in its encrypted configuration. This strategy offers malware a dependable and widely available C2 channel while minimizing the chances of its network communications being detected by security tools. Given that Google Sheets is commonly used in enterprise environments, blocking this service could be impractical, further reducing the likelihood of detection.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In 2023, the Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group APT41 was observed using Google Sheets as a C2 server, employing the red-teaming GC2 toolkit to facilitate this activity.

To defend against such campaigns, security firm Proofpoint recommends several measures: restricting access to external file-sharing services to trusted servers only, blocking connections to TryCloudflare when not actively required, and closely monitoring for suspicious PowerShell executions. These steps are advised to mitigate the risks posed by the Voldemort malware and similar threats.</div>

This campaign has sparked a heated debate between two tech giants, Apple and Google, over the best way to protect user privacy online.<p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Apple’s Stance on Privacy</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has long positioned itself as a champion of user <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/google-assures-privacy-with-gemini-ai.html" target="_blank">privacy</a>. In its latest campaign, Apple highlights the extensive use of tracking cookies by Google Chrome. These cookies, Apple claims, follow users across the web, collecting data on their browsing habits. Apple argues that Chrome’s Incognito mode, which many users rely on for private browsing, isn’t truly private. According to Apple, Incognito mode still allows websites to track user activity, albeit to a lesser extent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To counter these privacy concerns, Apple promotes its own browser, Safari, as a more secure alternative. Safari, Apple claims, uses Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) to limit the ability of advertisers to track users across websites. This feature, combined with other privacy-focused tools, makes Safari a more attractive option for users who prioritize their online privacy.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Google’s Response</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/google-assures-privacy-with-gemini-ai.html" target="_blank">Google</a>, on the other hand, has defended Chrome’s privacy practices. In response to Apple’s campaign, Google emphasized that Chrome is designed to keep user data safe and give users control over their privacy settings. Google points out that Chrome offers a range of privacy features, including the ability to block third-party cookies and manage site permissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google also highlights its commitment to transparency. The company regularly updates its privacy policies and provides users with clear information about how their data is collected and used. Google argues that this transparency, combined with robust privacy controls, makes Chrome a trustworthy choice for users.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Broader Context</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">This clash between Apple and Google is part of a larger conversation about online privacy. As more of our lives move online, the amount of data we generate has skyrocketed. This data is incredibly valuable to advertisers, who use it to target ads more effectively. However, this data collection has raised significant privacy concerns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many users are unaware of the extent to which their online activities are tracked. Even when using private browsing modes, such as Chrome’s Incognito mode, users may still be tracked by websites and advertisers. This has led to calls for greater transparency and stronger privacy protections.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the Right Browser</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">So, what does this mean for the average user? When choosing a browser, it’s important to consider your privacy needs. If you prioritize privacy and want to limit tracking as much as possible, Safari may be the better choice. Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention and other privacy features can help protect your data from advertisers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, if you value customization and control over your browsing experience, Chrome offers a range of privacy tools that can be tailored to your needs. Google’s transparency about its data collection practices also provides users with a clear understanding of how their data is used.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, the choice between Safari and Chrome comes down to personal preference. Both browsers have their strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will depend on your individual privacy needs and browsing habits.</p>

How New Android Malware Exploits NFC Technology" width="640" /></a></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Tap-to-pay technology, which allows users to make quick transactions with a simple tap of their smartphone, has become increasingly popular. However, with convenience comes <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/heres-how-to-safeguard-yourself-against.html" target="_blank">risk</a>. A recent discovery of a new Android malware by <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/ngate-android-malware-relays-nfc-traffic-to-steal-cash/" target="_blank">ESET</a>, known as NGate, has raised significant concerns about the security of tap-to-pay transactions. This blog will delve into how this malware operates, the potential risks it poses, and how users can protect themselves.</p><p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Understanding NGate Malware</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/protecting-your-wallet-understanding.html" target="_blank">NGate </a>is a sophisticated piece of malware designed to exploit the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology used in tap-to-pay transactions. NFC allows devices to communicate wirelessly when they are close to each other, making it ideal for contactless payments. However, this same technology can be manipulated by malicious actors to steal sensitive financial information.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">How NGate Works</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The NGate malware is typically spread through social engineering and phishing tactics. Attackers often disguise the malware as legitimate banking apps or other trusted applications. Once a user unknowingly installs the malware, it begins to operate in the background, capturing sensitive information.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most alarming features of NGate is its ability to clone contactless credit and debit cards. By exploiting the NFC feature, the malware can intercept and replicate the data transmitted during a tap-to-pay transaction. This cloned data can then be used by attackers to make unauthorized transactions, effectively draining the victim’s bank account.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Impact of NGate</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The implications of NGate are far-reaching. With the ability to clone contactless payment cards, attackers can carry out fraudulent transactions without the victim’s knowledge. This not only leads to financial loss but also undermines trust in tap-to-pay technology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the spread of NGate highlights the evolving tactics of cybercriminals. As technology advances, so do the methods used by attackers. This underscores the importance of staying vigilant and adopting robust security measures.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Protecting Yourself from NGate</h3><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li style="text-align: justify;">Always download apps from official app stores like Google Play. Be cautious of apps that request unnecessary permissions or seem suspicious.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Use built-in security features on your smartphone, such as biometric authentication and two-factor authentication (2FA). These add an extra layer of protection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Keep your device and apps updated. Security patches are often released to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Be cautious of unsolicited messages or emails that prompt you to download apps or provide personal information. Verify the source before taking any action.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Regularly check your bank statements and transaction history for any unauthorized activity. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank immediately.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Chrome, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

In 2022, the parent company of Block, the peer-to-peer payment platform, failed to prevent unauthorised access to Cash App customer accounts.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Cash App agreed to a $15 million class action settlement in exchange. Even though it was an internal change, users' concerns about the app's security were not allayed, despite the fact that it was a positive step. 

To learn more about how to better defend themselves, users urged the cybersecurity specialists to provide some safety tips.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“One of the biggest problems with money apps like this is their popularity,” stated Neal O’Farrell, a digital security expert and CNET Money expert review board member. “Hackers follow the crowds, and the more people use these apps, the more time criminals will spend trying to exploit them.”&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Cash App actually includes an array of security safety features. The difficulty is that, while they can help you avoid fraudsters, they cannot always keep your data secure. O'Farrell observed that even the finest privacy safeguards can be undermined by an insider with access, as happened in the Cash App case. Whether you wish to avoid financial frauds on Cash App or protect your sensitive information after it has been disclosed, here are three security procedures you should take in addition to claiming any settlement money you are owed.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Secure your sign-on&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">By default, Cash App makes signing in much safer by sending a code to your email address or phone number each time you log in. But there's a catch: after logging in, you must manually sign out of your account; otherwise, you can access your account from your phone without a code. I've signed out and signed back in without a code, which could be a concern if someone gains access to your phone and the app.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">To be on the safe side, experts recommend logging out once you've finished completing transactions. You can add two-factor authentication as a second layer of account security, but you'll need to download a separate app, such as Google Authenticator.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Don’t send money to strangers</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">From romance scams to tax scams, there are numerous ways for perpetrators to trick you into sending money using Cash App or other payment apps. Experts recommended not to send money to strangers and always double-checking their phone number or email address before sending. If you mistakenly send money to the wrong person or discover you were scammed on a Cash App, banks will often refuse to refund your money.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">O'Farrell advises being wary of any messages you receive via payment apps. He frequently sees scams in which someone poses as a friend and asks for money or claims you owe them money. Others may attempt to steal access to your app and money by requesting that you verify your security code so that they can resolve a security issue with your account.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">A few things can help you figure out who you're giving money to. Cash App's Incoming Requests option, available under the Security &amp; Privacy menu, will only allow you to give money to a specific contact rather than everyone else on the app. You can also prevent people from finding your Cash App account by disabling the "$CashTag Cash.app" option in the same security page.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Monitor your transaction activity&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Beyond data security, it's critical to monitor your account's behaviour. To receive text messages and emails about your transactions, enable push alerts under Cash App's 'Notifications' option. This allows you to track all of your payment activities and keep an eye out for anything odd.</span></div></span>

The breach occurred when a hacker gained unauthorised access to the company’s Google G-Suite account, affecting all employees using the "@unicoin.com" domain. As a result, employees were locked out of critical Google services like Gmail and Google Drive, causing major disruptions in internal communication and file sharing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Unicoin detailed the extent of the attack, noting that the hacker not only altered account passwords but also restricted access to essential tools. The company managed to restore access to its systems by August 13, 2024. However, ongoing investigations have revealed additional issues stemming from the breach.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Several senior management email accounts were compromised, and further investigations uncovered anomalies in the personal information of employees and contractors. The company’s accounting department discovered several discrepancies, including an instance of identity forgery involving a contractor, which led to their immediate termination. Investigators are still determining whether these incidents are isolated or part of a larger cyber threat, potentially involving North Korean hackers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Financial Impact and Investigation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the severity of the breach, Unicoin has assured its stakeholders that there is no evidence of stolen funds or compromised cryptocurrency assets. While the situation is serious, the company stated that the attack has not immensely impacted its financial condition or operational performance. However, the full extent of the breach is still under review, and Unicoin has not ruled out the possibility of long-term financial consequences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In its SEC filing, Unicoin emphasised that no immediate financial losses had been identified. The company has committed to continuing its assessment of the situation and will report any significant impact in future filings if necessary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cybersecurity Concerns in the Cryptocurrency Sector</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unicoin's adherence to regulatory compliance stands out in the cryptocurrency industry, where oversight is often limited. The company consistently files reports with the SEC, demonstrating its commitment to transparency. With more than $500 million in Unicoins sold and a diverse portfolio that includes real estate and equity investments, the recent cyberattack is a telling event of how even the well regulated firms are not immune to combating such vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As investigations continue, the broader cryptocurrency industry will be closely monitoring Unicoin's response to this breach and the steps it takes to better amp up its cybersecurity defenses.</p>

The campaign, which began in July 2024, involved a series of deceptive emails promoting a supposed podcast titled “Exploring Jewish Life in the Muslim World.” The attackers masqueraded as representatives of the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a legitimate American non-profit think tank focused on military and foreign affairs research.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On July 22, 2024, TA453 initiated contact with the target by sending an email from an address claiming to represent ISW’s Research Director. The email invited the recipient to participate in the podcast, a lure that successfully engaged the target. After initial correspondence, TA453 sent a DocSend URL containing a password-protected text file with a legitimate ISW podcast link. Researchers from Proofpoint believe this initial interaction was intended to build trust with the target, making them more likely to click on malicious links in future communications.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Following the initial lure, TA453 escalated their attack by sending a Google Drive URL that led to a ZIP archive. This archive contained a malicious LNK file, which, when opened, deployed the BlackSmith toolset, including the AnvilEcho PowerShell trojan. AnvilEcho is a sophisticated malware capable of intelligence gathering and data exfiltration. It employs encryption and network communication techniques to evade detection, integrating multiple capabilities within a single PowerShell script.

The trojan’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure is hosted on a domain linked to previous TA453 operations.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">AnvilEcho continuously fetches and executes commands from the remote server via its “Do-It” function, which handles various tasks, including network connectivity, file manipulation, screenshot capture, and audio recording. The “Redo-It” function, located at the end of the malware’s code, orchestrates these commands while also collecting system reconnaissance data such as antivirus status, operating system details, and user information.

According to researchers, the activities of TA453 are likely aimed at supporting intelligence collection for the Iranian government, specifically the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Intelligence Organization.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The tactics employed in this campaign bear a strong resemblance to those used by the Charming Kitten advanced persistent threat (APT) group, another Iranian cyber espionage unit. This operation is a classic example of multi-persona impersonation, where threat actors leverage legitimate links to build trust with victims before launching more harmful attacks.</div>

As part of this consequential development, Google has reassured users about the strong privacy and security measures surrounding their personal data, addressing growing concerns in the digital age.</span></div><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A Strong Focus on Privacy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In an exclusive interview with Aayush Ailawadi from Business Today, Sameer Samat, the President of Google’s Android Ecosystem, emphasised that user privacy is a top priority for the company. He explained that for any AI assistant, especially one as advanced as Gemini, safeguarding user data is crucial. According to Samat, Google's longstanding commitment to privacy and security has been a cornerstone of its approach to developing Android. He pointed out that for a personal assistant to be genuinely useful, it must also be trusted to keep conversations and data secure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Samat highlighted Google’s extensive experience and investment in artificial intelligence as a key advantage. He noted that Google controls every aspect of the AI process, from optimising the AI on users’ devices to managing it in the cloud. This comprehensive control ensures that the technology operates securely and efficiently across all platforms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the standout features of the Gemini AI, according to Samat, is its ability to handle personal queries and tasks entirely within Google’s ecosystem, without involving third-party providers. This approach minimises the risk of data exposure and ensures that users' information remains within the trusted boundaries of Google’s systems. Samat stressed upon the fine details of this feature for users who are particularly concerned about who has access to their personal data.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>AI That Works for Everyday Life</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">When asked about the broader implications of AI, Samat expressed his belief that AI technology should be open-source to better serve consumers. He emphasised that AI needs to be more than just a intricately designed tool— it should be something that genuinely helps people in their daily lives.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Samat shared an example from his personal experience to illustrate this point. While researching a used car purchase, he used Gemini AI to quickly gather important information that would typically take much longer to find. The AI assistant provided him with a concise list of questions to ask the mechanic, reducing what would have been an hour-long research task to just a few minutes. This practical application, Samat suggested, is what consumers really value—technology that saves them time and makes life easier.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google’s latest developments with Gemini AI signal a shift in focus from merely advancing technology to making it more accessible and beneficial for everyday use. This reflects a broader trend in the tech industry, where the goal is to ensure that innovations are not only cutting-edge but also practical and user-friendly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google’s Gemini AI aims to offer users a more secure and private experience while also being a pragmatic tool for daily tasks. With its focus on preserving privacy, controlled data management, and utility, Google is setting new standards for how AI can convenience our lives while keeping personal information safe.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0GQBfYbb0frVtyhYLi3yiA.png" /></figure><p>As mentioned in our <a href="/mitre-attack/attack-2024-roadmap-8dfc46d1ad1b">2024 Roadmap</a> and the <a href="/mitre-attack/attack-v15-26685f300acc">v15 release blog</a>, we’re excited to introduce our new TAXII server and the latest addition to the ATT&amp;CK Workbench software suite: the <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 Server</a>. We’ve open-sourced the TAXII 2.1 code on <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub</a>, allowing you to set up your own servers within your organization <em>and </em>contribute to its improvement.</p><p>While you’re diving into the new 2.1 server, don’t forget: our TAXII 2.0 server is retiring on <strong>December 18.</strong></p><p><strong>To continue receiving updated ATT&amp;CK data, you’ll need to migrate from cti-taxii.mitre.org to attack-taxii.mitre.org. However, this migration may involve more than just a URL change. Given the transition from STIX 2.0 to STIX 2.1, the complexity of your migration will depend on how deeply your applications are integrated with STIX 2.0. We recommend assessing the impact on your systems and planning your migration accordingly.</strong></p><p><strong>Getting Started with TAXII 2.1</strong></p><p>Ready to explore the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 server?</p><ul><li>Visit our <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub repository</a> for the source code and detailed <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md">usage documentation</a>.</li><li>Leverage the <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-deployment">ATT&amp;CK Workbench Deployment</a> repository with <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-deployment/blob/main/compose.yaml">Docker Compose templates</a> to simplify setting up Workbench services and the TAXII 2.1 module (so you can pull the Docker images from GitHub and get started without building from source!).</li><li>Skip the source code and pull the TAXII 2.1 Docker image directly from the <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/pkgs/container/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub Container Registry</a>.</li><li>Access the server <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api-docs/">Swagger interface</a> and <a href="https://www.usebruno.com/">Bruno API Client</a> definitions (Bruno, similar to Postman, provides an easy way to interact with REST APIs). You can find our <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/tree/main/bruno">Bruno files here</a>.</li><li>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107514">OASIS TAXII 2.1 specification</a> to enhance your integration prowess.</li><li>Experience issues? Submit <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/issues/new/choose">specific requests or encounter issues</a> on GitHub.</li></ul><p><strong>Why TAXII 2.1?</strong></p><p>We know the ATT&amp;CK community has relied on our public TAXII 2.0 server, but it had issues like frequent outages. The TAXII 2.1 server addresses these problems with a more reliable and smooth experience. It’s built for scalability and stress-tested with real-world benchmarks from TAXII 2.0, ensuring you’re less likely to face major outages. Additionally, the new server introduces pagination, which was missing in TAXII 2.0. This means you can fetch smaller chunks of data instead of the entire ~20 MB STIX collection, speeding up the process and reducing data transfer costs.</p><p>A critical update to note is that our TAXII 2.1 server will exclusively host STIX 2.1 content moving forward. This change is part of our long-term strategy to shift away from STIX 2.0, aligning with the latest standards.</p><p>The new TAXII 2.1 server is also more powerful and capable than the previous version. We designed it to smoothly integrate with Workbench, making CTI management as seamless as possible. If you’re already using the ATT&amp;CK Workbench in your CTI workflows, you can easily edit and maintain CTI data without needing additional tools. The TAXII 2.1 server integrates with the ATT&amp;CK Workbench software suite, and can automatically synch with the Workbench REST API (the Workbench “back end”).</p><p>Workbench users can add objects, STIX collections, and bundles, and the TAXII 2.1 server will automatically make them available via its REST API. You don’t need to change your editor workflows — just bring the TAXII 2.1 server online in your Workbench container stack, and it will sync every 30 minutes by default (administrators can adjust this if needed). TAXII 2.1 is also optional, and you can continue using Workbench as usual without it.</p><p>Of note, the TAXII 2.1 specification outlines two “sharing models” for TAXII server implementations:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Collection model</strong>, where the TAXII server allows producers to host a set of CTI data that can be requested by consumers: TAXII Clients and Servers exchange information in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">request-response model</a>.</li><li>The <strong>Channel model</strong>, where the TAXII server uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe pattern</a> to allow producers to push data to many consumers and consumers to receive data from many producers.</li></ul><p>Given that Channels are still loosely defined in the TAXII specification, we decided to only implement the Collections model outlined in the TAXII 2.1 specification. However, we are open to adding support for a pub-sub model in future releases.</p><p><strong>A Brief Guide to Accessing Threat Intelligence Data</strong></p><p>With the new TAXII 2.1 server, you can still access your cyber threat intel in STIX format through the publicly accessible REST API, just like its <a href="http://cti-taxii.mitre.org/">predecessor</a> (cti-taxii.mitre.org) that’s been around for <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/att-ck-content-available-in-stix-2-0-via-public-taxii-2-0-server-317e5c41e214">over 6 years</a>. Even though this server has some sophisticated functionality, querying it is actually pretty simple. This following guide will show you the basics and help you easily get the threat intelligence data you need.</p><p>With TAXII 2.1 running on a RESTful API model and using standard HTTP requests, you can connect to the server using any HTTP client you like. This includes popular tools like curl, wget, httpie, or Postman. This flexibility allows you to seamlessly integrate TAXII 2.1 queries into your existing workflows and tools.</p><p>Let’s dive into how to structure these requests and interpret the responses.</p><p>Importantly, all TAXII 2.1 requests require a special Accept header:</p><pre>GET /taxii2/ HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1 Host: attack-taxii.mitre.org</pre><p>Here is an example of setting the Accept header using the curl tool:</p><pre>curl --request GET \<br />  --url https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/taxii2/ \<br />  --header ‘Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1’</pre><p>The request above sends a request to the TAXII server’s <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107497">Discovery endpoint</a>, which returns a list of available API roots that the TAXII server offers. Each API Root is the “root” URL of that particular instance of the TAXII API. Our TAXII server only hosts one API Root, which we can see clearly from the response body:</p><pre>{ <br />  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MITRE ATT&amp;CK TAXII 2.1&quot;, <br />  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This API Root contains TAXII 2.1 REST API endpoints that serve MITRE ATT&amp;CK STIX 2.1 data&quot;, <br />  &quot;default&quot;: &quot;api/v21&quot;, <br />  &quot;api_roots&quot;: [ <br />    &quot;api/v21&quot; <br />  ] <br />} </pre><p>Great! Now that we have the API Root, let’s see if we can query for a list of available <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107500">TAXII Collections</a>:</p><pre>curl --request GET \  <br />    --url https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/ \  <br />    --header 'Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1' </pre><p>The response should look something like the following:</p><pre>{<br />  “collections”: [<br />    {<br />      “id”: “x-mitre-collection — 1f5f1533-f617–4ca8–9ab4–6a02367fa019”,<br />      “title”: “Enterprise ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      “description”: “ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise provides a knowledge base of real-world adversary behavior targeting traditional enterprise networks. ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise covers the following platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, PRE, Office 365, Google Workspace, IaaS, Network, and Containers.”,<br />      “canRead”: true,<br />      “canWrite”: false,<br />      “mediaTypes”: [<br />        “application/taxii+json;version=2.1”,<br />        “application/taxii+json”<br />      ]<br />    },<br />    {<br />      id”: “x-mitre-collection — 90c00720–636b-4485-b342–8751d232bf09”,<br />      “title”: “ICS ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      …<br />    },<br />    {<br />      “id”: “x-mitre-collection — dac0d2d7–8653–445c-9bff-82f934c1e858”,<br />      “title”: “Mobile ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      …<br />    }<br />  ]<br />}</pre><p>The response lists three objects that match the main ATT&amp;CK domains: Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS. Of note, <em>TAXII Collections</em> and <em>STIX Collections</em> are different concepts — with TAXII Collections operating as versatile containers for CTI objects. For our MITRE ATT&amp;CK TAXII server, we’ve mapped each TAXII Collection directly to an ATT&amp;CK domain. This means querying a TAXII Collection from our server provides data from just one domain, simplifying the user experience and aligning with the ATT&amp;CK framework. While this mapping isn’t required by the TAXII protocol and other servers may organize collections differently, we chose this method to make our server more intuitive for the ATT&amp;CK community.</p><p>Now that we have our API Root and the available TAXII Collections, we’re ready to <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107539">retrieve some CTI objects</a>:</p><pre>curl --request GET \<br />  --url 'https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/x-mitre-collection--dac0d2d7-8653-445c-9bff-82f934c1e858/objects?limit=100' \<br />  --header ‘Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1’</pre><p>This request sends a request for the first 100 objects from the Enterprise ATT&amp;CK collection. The response should look something like this:</p><pre>{<br />  “more”: true,<br />  “next”: “1”,<br />  “objects”: [←100 →]<br />}</pre><p>If the ‘more’ property is set to true and the ‘next’ property is populated, then the client can paginate through the remaining records using the ‘next’ URL parameter along with the same original query options. So, we can request the second page of 100 objects by simply adding the ‘next=1’ query parameter to the original request:</p><pre>curl --request GET \  <br />    --url 'https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/x-mitre-collection--dac0d2d7-8653-445c-9bff-82f934c1e858/objects?limit=100&amp;next=1' \  <br />    --header 'Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1' </pre><p><strong>What’s Next for ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1</strong></p><p>We believe the release of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 server is a big step forward for threat intelligence sharing — and we have even more exciting integrations on our roadmap to make the TAXII experience even smoother:</p><ul><li>Workbench UI indicators that signal whether an object or collection is actively being shared through TAXII;</li><li>Workbench UI toggles that allow users to pause (or enable) the sharing objects and collections with TAXII;</li><li>Workbench role-based access controls (RBAC) for TAXII administration.</li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we continue to evolve our tools!</p><p>©2024 The MITRE Corporation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Guest Post by ATT&amp;CKcon 3.0 Keynote Speaker, Selena Larson</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Lt18htHq69IsEJ-3staO2w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Allan Pinkerton (Alexander Gardner — Library of Congress)</figcaption></figure><p>At the onset of the Civil War, a man whose name would eventually become synonymous with famous American detectives was reportedly providing false reports to the Union’s top general. Allan Pinkerton, who once successfully smuggled Abraham Lincoln into Washington, D.C. to avoid a rumored assassination attempt before he was even sworn in as president, acted as General George McClellan’s top intelligence officer. He was considered one of the best spymasters in the United States, responsible for effectively founding the nation’s first secret service.</p><p>In this piece, we’ll dive into some major intelligence reporting failures that dogged the renowned spymaster, how effective and concise intelligence reporting can change the course of history, and how the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework can help streamline and effectively communicate actionable threat intelligence.</p><p>Pinkerton was a detective when he first got to know Lincoln, but quickly became an indispensable intelligencer for the Union, first in the nation’s capital and then on the battlefield, working as a Civil War spymaster in 1861–1862. He operated a large team of spies who conducted counterespionage operations throughout Washington and information gathering expeditions into enemy territory. Pinkerton’s successes and failures are many — he made many of his own tactical intelligence failures that cost at least one spy his life during the Civil War — but there is a lot modern day intelligence analysts can learn from him. Specifically, from his intelligence reports.</p><p>According to author Douglas Waller, author of <em>Lincoln’s Spies</em>, Pinkerton was not very good at validating or communicating information, or transforming it from data into intelligence. Throughout his time operating a secret service on behalf of the Union, he collected a lot of information. But that information was frequently poorly vetted, based on single sources, or received from biased narrators. And often, the information was ineffectively communicated, or outright falsified.</p><p>By dissecting the failures of the nation’s first intelligence service spymaster, modern day threat intelligence analysts can learn how and why effective intelligence communication and report writing can have major effects on an organization — and, in some cases, have the potential to change the course of history.</p><p><strong>HiPPO Bias</strong></p><p>One of the biggest failures plaguing Pinkerton’s reporting apparatus was his desire to please his boss. General McClellan was famously slow to take any offensive actions against the enemy, holding a deep fear of failure that paralyzed him into inaction.</p><p>McClellan reportedly believed the Confederate military to be much larger than it actually was, in part due to the “intelligence” provided to him by his top spy. In fact, the relationship between Pinkerton and McClellan was more like a self-licking ice cream cone. While stationed with McClellan in Washington, Virginia, and Maryland, Pinkerton worked his network of operators to collect information on enemy troop movement and the size of the Confederate army. Sometimes information proved to be correct; other times it was outright false. But in most cases, Pinkerton cherry-picked data that supported his boss’s beliefs of an opposing force either equal to or out-sizing the Union military, ignoring accurate information on the small size of the Confederate forces and further inflating already inflated estimates to appeal to McClellan’s beliefs.</p><blockquote>“Loyal to the point of sycophancy, Pinkerton never doubted the general’s ability as a commander. Instead of serving his country or his president as a true intelligence officer, he made his friend happy.” <em>Lincoln’s Spies</em></blockquote><p>Pinkerton was demonstrating Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO) bias, or the idea that analysts collect and disseminate information in a way that favors or appeals to existing beliefs within an organization, typically driven by leadership.</p><blockquote>“Pinkerton admitted that he and McClellan had conspired to cook the books. In a later November 15 letter to the general, Pinkerton explained that his estimate of Confederate strength ‘was made large, as intimated to you at the time, so as to be sure to cover the entire number of the Enemy that our army was to meet.’ The controversial sentence appeared to show that before Pinkerton issued his October 4 report [reporting double the total number of actual Confederate troops], he and McClellan agreed to deliberately inflate the confederate numbers to be sure they included troops Pinkerton’s agents might not know about. ”</blockquote><p>This can be a frequent issue for analysts tasked with certain objectives and directives, but it can also be detrimental to the organization’s decision making and ultimate success. For example, if leadership believes that Russian state-sponsored threats are the most important and likely the most targeted to their organization, defenders and analysts will be spending more key resources hunting for and defending against these threats, with the potential to miss or disregard tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with other relevant, but different, activity.</p><p><em>Use data to build your case.</em> In her 2019 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba5jh8uhTBU&amp;ab_channel=mitrecorp">ATT&amp;CKcon 2.0 keynote</a>, Google’s Toni Gidwandi explained how the MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix can be a “powerful corrective” to HiPPO bias and enable security teams to understand what is happening in the landscape and how it translates to impacts on their organizations.</p><p>Beyond indicators of compromise (IOCs), ATT&amp;CK allows defenders to visualize threat behaviors in a digestible way to show what TTPs are observed and impacting an organization versus what stakeholders expect or want to focus on.</p><p>Analysts can create mappings of MITRE ATT&amp;CK to malware, malware families and techniques observed in their environment. Subsequently, analysts can craft search queries to help with threat hunting and detection efforts. For example, mapping and searching on specific execution techniques such as certutil or BITSAdmin which are being used to download follow-on payloads.</p><p>By identifying the most impactful behaviors, and possible gaps in defense, security teams can prioritize hunting, detection, and response based on observable threat behaviors rather than requests or knee-jerk reactions from stakeholders.</p><p>Ultimately, Pinkerton’s analysis failed his organization — his reporting coupled with McClellan’s ego and general aversion to taking decisive action may have cost the Union military successes early on in the Civil War.</p><p><strong>Reporting Is Not Letter Writing</strong></p><p>In addition to some reports containing easily disproved inaccuracies, Pinkerton and many of his staff typically wrote very long reports, with much of the key details hidden among flowery language, tens of pages deep. Effectively communicating actionable intelligence is a common issue with cyber threat intelligence dissemination, and it’s nice to know our predecessors experienced similar flaws.</p><blockquote>“He always wrote [intelligence reports] in the form of a letter, and they began with a flowery opening officers of the day commonly used, such as ‘I have the honor to report…’” <em>Lincoln’s Spies</em></blockquote><p>Pinkerton also reportedly doodled in the margins, drawing cartoon fingers to indicate what the most important parts of the reports were.</p><p>Succinctly and effectively communicating intelligence through written reports is difficult, but there are some key characteristics of good intelligence reporting that can help improve efficiency, streamline the writing process, and provide stakeholders with relevant data.</p><p><em>Put the most important information first</em>.<strong> </strong>Frequently referred to as the stating Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF), immediately detailing the findings of your reporting and why they matter to an organization is crucial. This can be considered the “So What?” portion of the report. Most people — especially key stakeholders like executive audiences — will not read every word of an in-depth intelligence report. It is therefore important to ensure that in the short amount of time allotted for consuming reporting, they can read and understand the points that matter most.</p><p><em>Be concise</em>. Pinkerton didn’t need flowery language and neither do you. I have said this before, but I firmly believe people should not require a thesaurus to read and understand threat intelligence reporting. The report should contain relevant information such as: What happened, why does it matter, and what can we do about it? Items such as anecdotes, extraneous clauses, and navel-gazing are generally unnecessary.</p><p><em>Consider your audience</em>.<strong> </strong>Executives likely don’t need details of deconstructed malware. Security operations analysts likely don’t need geopolitical analysis of events occurring in places where the business does not operate. Threat intelligence analysts should always be aware of who is reading reports and why. Make sure you know the answer to: What decisions are being made based on this data? Gathering intelligence requirements and understanding how your audience is using intelligence throughout the organization can help shape and improve your reporting.</p><p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK has become the universal framework for threat actor TTPs, and can be used to quickly distill and communicate threat intelligence. But where and how it’s used varies based on the audience receiving the information.</p><p>For example, in February 2022, intelligence agencies from the United States and United Kingdom published <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Joint-Sandworm-Advisory.pdf">a joint advisory</a> on a new malware called Cyclops Blink targeting small office/home office routers attributed to the Russian state actor Sandworm. The 10-page advisory was designed as an overview of the malware and related threats, documenting Sandworm’s historic and current activity and its relevance in the overall threat landscape. In this report, the MITRE ATT&amp;CK mappings were presented at the end, to add additional insight and technical details to an otherwise fairly high-level, strategic report. However, in a companion <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyclops-Blink-Malware-Analysis-Report.pdf">malware analysis report</a> published by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, the ATT&amp;CK mappings were presented on page three of 20, demonstrating the framework can be used to summarize tactical threat intelligence.</p><p>Like any tool, where and how you use MITRE ATT&amp;CK to document TTPs is crucial for an audience’s understanding of the threats.</p><p><strong>Always Evaluate OSINT</strong></p><p>While Pinkerton collected massive amounts of information and distributed it whole cloth to his superiors, there was little explanation given to where the information came from or its validity.</p><blockquote>“Rarely did Pinkerton include in his reports an evaluation of a source’s reliability beyond a general impression he had of it.” <em>Lincoln’s Spies</em></blockquote><p>Pinkerton was operating based on human intelligence, information collected by his operatives in the field. Much of it was gossip; some of it reached his ears by a convoluted game of telephone. A lot of it was reliable and accurate — some of it was not.</p><p>As intelligence analysts, understanding and evaluating the veracity of information is crucial to communicating and acting on it. Primary sources of intelligence — the data we collect on our networks — we typically understand to be reliable. But we also rely on open source intelligence (OSINT) to form a whole picture of adversary threat behaviors and an understanding of the threat landscape.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad information on the internet. The online <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/02/1046646/the-propaganda-war-has-eclipsed-cyberwar-in-ukraine/">claims</a> of unconfirmed hacking campaigns during the ongoing war in Ukraine is an excellent example of information spreading far and wide without validation, and likely making it into intelligence briefings on the conflict.</p><p>There are multiple questions analysts should ask themselves when reviewing third-party data to support original research, for example:</p><ul><li>What is the visibility of the individual or organization?</li><li>What evidence are their claims based on?</li><li>Is this evidence available to me?</li><li>Does this overlap with known threat activity?</li><li><em>Cui bono</em>? Or, who benefits and how?</li></ul><p>There is always inherent bias in visibility; vendors or anti-virus companies will only have data from the organizations and geographies in which it is used. If the visibility is limited, it might not be an effective source for verifying or supporting existing hypotheses. Being able to independently validate or invalidate evidence provided in open-source artifacts with internal tools and resources can help further your own investigations or reporting. And finally, considering political, financial, economic, etc. motivations in external reporting can help identify potential biases in reporting and inform your assessments of a source’s reliability.</p><p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework exists in part to help answer these questions, especially for providing validated, authoritative third-party intelligence reporting.</p><p><strong>A Dictionary of Threats</strong></p><p>While the United States was fighting the bloodiest war in the nation’s history, an idea was blossoming among philologists in the United Kingdom. English speakers had colonized many parts of the world, with English customs and culture forcing itself into existing cultures and communities, with paltry existing resources standardizing vocabulary. Academics in the UK argued that there should be a single authoritative resource to define the English language, documenting and establishing the correct form of communications.</p><p>Formally <a href="https://archive.org/details/onsomedeficienci00trenrich/page/n7/mode/2up">proposed in 1857</a>, what would become known as the Oxford English Dictionary would eventually achieve its goal of standardizing English words beginning in 1884. It was a massive undertaking that brought together academics, historians, and the English-speaking public to collect and define words. In fact, the dictionary could not have been written without considerable public assistance.</p><p>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework has become the universal dictionary of TTPs, in large part due to contributions from analysts and researchers around the globe. According to MITRE, 155 people contributed to the framework in 2021. (In fact, this year my Proofpoint colleague Michael Raggi contributed an update to ATT&amp;CK <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221/">Technique T1221</a> to include a novel <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/injection-new-black-novel-rtf-template-inject-technique-poised-widespread">RTF template injection technique</a> observed in use by multiple threat actors.)</p><p>The authoritative nature of the framework has allowed analysts to verify open-source reporting, and better understand the nature of threat actors. It has also allowed researchers to more effectively document and communicate threat behaviors, prioritize detections, and improve defense. By standardizing how we identify and classify threat behaviors, actionable intelligence can be more easily communicated to a variety of stakeholders.</p><p>Pinkerton did not have a reliable threat intelligence framework or dictionary off which to operate; indeed he was trailblazing the creation of a secret service that had never before existed. And while his early work helped pave the way for modern day spying and the development of the Secret Service, he and his team were far from perfect. But by examining the intelligence reporting failures documented by modern historians, threat intelligence analysts can be better prepared when they too one day may be called on to help change the course of history.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=35be8d12884" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/intelligence-failures-of-lincolns-top-spies-what-cti-analysts-can-learn-from-the-civil-war-35be8d12884">Intelligence Failures of Lincoln’s Top Spies: What CTI Analysts Can Learn From the Civil War</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack">MITRE ATT&amp;CK®</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Dave Kleidermacher, VP Engineering, Android Security and Privacy, and Giles Hogben, Senior Director, Privacy Engineering, Android</span>

<p>
Your smartphone holds a lot of your personal information to help you get things done every day. On Android, we are seamlessly integrating the latest artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, like Gemini as a trusted assistant – capable of handling life's essential tasks. As such, ensuring your privacy and security on Android is paramount. As a pioneer in responsible AI and cutting-edge privacy technologies like <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/trust-in-transparency-private-compute.html">Private Compute Core</a> and <a href="https://research.google/blog/federated-learning-collaborative-machine-learning-without-centralized-training-data/">federated learning</a>, we made sure our approach to the assistant experience with Gemini on Android is aligned with our existing <a href="https://safety.google/cybersecurity-advancements/saif/">Secure AI framework</a>, <a href="https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/">AI Principles</a> and <a href="https://safety.google/principles/">Privacy Principles</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We’ve always safeguarded your data with an integrated stack of world-class secure infrastructure and technology, delivering end-to-end protection in a way that only Google can. From privacy on-device when handling sensitive data to the world’s best cloud infrastructure, here are six key ways we keep your information private and protected.
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>We don’t hand off to a third-party AI provider.</strong>
<p>

    Gemini Apps can help you with complex, personal tasks from creating workout routines to helping you get started on a resume. And it does the hard work for you all within Google's ecosystem. The core processing is done by Gemini within Google's secure cloud infrastructure and there are no handoffs to third-party chatbots or AI providers that you may not know or trust. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>On-device AI privacy for sensitive tasks, even when offline.</strong>
<p>

    For some AI features, like <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/gemini-nano-google-pixel/">Summarize in Recorder</a> on Pixel, that benefit from additional data privacy or processing efficiency, we utilize on-device AI. <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/">Gemini Nano</a>, the first multimodal model designed to run on mobile devices, delivers on-device AI processing for some of your most sensitive tasks without relying on cloud connectivity. You can enjoy features like summarizing text even when you’re offline. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>World-class cloud infrastructure that is secure by default, private by design.</strong>
<p>

    For AI tasks that use data already in the cloud or have complex demands that require more processing power than what’s possible on-device, we use Google’s highly secure cloud infrastructure. Backed by Google’s world-class security and privacy infrastructure and processes, these data centers benefit from the same robust defenses that have kept Google products safe for billions of users for more than 20 years. So you can ask Gemini to find details in your lease agreement saved in your Google Drive and that data is protected by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/production-services-protection">advanced monitoring against unauthorized access</a> or misuse. We also enforce strict software supply chain controls to ensure that only approved and verified code runs in our cloud environment.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>Control how you interact with Gemini Apps.</strong><p>

    We've designed the Gemini Apps experience with careful consideration for how you access it and control it. You can review and choose the Gemini experiences you want – when and where they’re needed most. And at any time, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13666746?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;oco=1#zippy=%2Cin-the-gemini-mobile-apps">review your Gemini Apps chats</a>, pin them, <a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13278892?sjid=2800487149694713106-NC">or delete them</a>. Android also gives you control over how apps such as Gemini respond when your device is locked.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>Pioneering new privacy technologies.</strong><p>

    We’re always working to develop new ways to keep your data even more private and secure. We continue to innovate in advancing privacy-preserving technologies, like <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/README.md">sealed computing technology</a>, which can be used to process sensitive workloads for enhanced privacy in a secure cloud enclave. Sealed computing ensures no one, including Google, can access the data. It can be thought of as extending the user’s device and its security boundaries into our cloud infrastructure, providing a virtual smartphone in the sky.</p>
</li><li><p><b>A new level of transparency.</b><br /><br />Transparency is in Android’s open-source DNA.&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/android/binary_transparency/overview">Android binary transparency</a>&nbsp;already allows anyone to verify the operating system code against a transparency log to ensure it hasn't been tampered with, much like matching fingerprint biometrics to confirm someone's identity. Binary transparency is extended in sealed computing environments to include&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/project-oak/oak/blob/main/README.md#remote-attestation">reproducible builds</a>. This ensures anyone can rebuild the trusted firmware base and verify that the resulting binaries match what is remotely attested as running in production and published in public transparency logs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Our Commitment to Safeguarding Your Data</strong></h3>Just like with all Google products, we believe you should be able to enjoy the benefits of Android without having to worry about security and privacy. That's why we invest so much in building world-class protections into our products and services from the start. We look forward to continuing to make AI helpful and intuitive, allowing you to focus on what matters most, while we take care of safeguarding your data.
<p></p>
<p>
<strong><em>Keep a lookout for more information about our end-to-end approach to AI privacy in an upcoming whitepaper. </em></strong></p>

<title>Post-Quantum Cryptography: Standards and Progress</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Royal Hansen, VP, Privacy, Safety and Security Engineering, Google, and Phil Venables, VP, TI Security & CISO, Google Cloud</span>

<p>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) just released three finalized standards for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) covering public key encapsulation and two forms of digital signatures. In progress since 2016, this achievement represents a major milestone towards standards development that will keep information on the Internet secure and confidential for many years to come. 
</p>
<p>
Here's a brief overview of what PQC is, how Google is using PQC, and how other organizations can adopt these new standards. You can also read more about PQC and Google's role in the standardization process <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-is-preparing-for-a-post-quantum-world/?e=48754805">in this 2022 post from Cloud CISO Phil Venables</a>.
</p>
<h2>What is PQC?</h2>


<p>
Encryption is central to keeping information confidential and secure on the Internet. Today, most Internet sessions in modern browsers are encrypted to prevent anyone from eavesdropping or altering the data in transit. Digital signatures are also crucial to online trust, from code signing proving that programs haven't been tampered with, to signals that can be relied on for confirming online identity.
</p>
<p>
Modern encryption technologies are secure because the computing power required to "crack the code" is very large; larger than any computer in existence today or the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, that's an advantage that won't last forever. Practical large-scale <a href="https://quantumai.google/discover/whatisqc">quantum computers</a> are still years away, but computer scientists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">have known for decades</a> that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) could break existing forms of asymmetric key cryptography.
</p>
<p>
PQC is the effort to defend against that risk, by defining standards and collaboratively implementing new algorithms that will resist attacks by both classical and quantum computers.
</p>
<p>
You don't need a quantum computer to use post-quantum cryptography, or to prepare. All of the standards released by NIST today run on the classical computers we currently use.
</p>
<h2>How is encryption at risk?</h2>


<p>
While a CRQC doesn't exist yet, devices and data from today will still be relevant in future. Some risks are already here:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Stored Data</strong> Through an attack known as <em>Store Now, Decrypt Later</em>, encrypted data captured and saved by attackers is stored for later decryption, with the help of as-yet unbuilt quantum computers

<li><strong>Hardware Products</strong> Defenders must ensure that future attackers cannot forge a digital signature and implant compromised firmware, or software updates, on pre-quantum devices that are still in use
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more information on CRQC-related risks, see our <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5108747984306176/google-s-threat-model-for-post-quantum-cryptography">PQC Threat Model post</a>.
</p>
<h2>How can organizations prepare for PQC migrations?</h2>


<p>
Migrating to new cryptographic algorithms is often a slow process, even when weaknesses affect widely-used crypto systems, because of organizational and logistical challenges in fully completing the transition to new technologies. For example, NIST deprecated SHA-1 hashing algorithms in 2011 and recommends complete phase-out by 2030.
</p>
<p>
That’s why it's crucial to take steps now to improve organizational preparedness, independent of PQC, with the goal of making your transition to PQC easier.
</p>
<p>
These <em>crypto agility</em> best practices can be enacted anytime:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Cryptographic inventory</strong> Understanding where and how organizations are using cryptography includes knowing what cryptographic algorithms are in use, and critically, managing key material safely and securely 

<li><strong>Key rotation</strong> Any new cryptographic system will require the ability to generate new keys and move them to production without causing outages. Just like testing recovery from backups, regularly testing key rotation should be part of any good resilience plan

<li><strong>Abstraction layers</strong> You can use a tool like <a href="https://developers.google.com/tink">Tink, Google's multi-language, cross-platform open source library</a>, designed to make it easy for non-specialists to use cryptography safely, and to switch between cryptographic algorithms without extensive code refactoring

<li><strong>End-to-end testing</strong> PQC algorithms have different properties. Notably, public keys, ciphertexts, and signatures are significantly larger. Ensure that all layers of the stack function as expected
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04623-2">2022 paper "Transitioning organizations to post-quantum cryptography"</a> provides additional recommendations to help organizations prepare and this <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6182336647790592/cryptographic-agility-and-key-rotation">recent post from the Google Security Blog</a> has more detail on cryptographic agility and key rotation.
</p>
<h2>Google's PQC Commitments</h2>


<p>
Google takes these risks seriously, and is taking steps on multiple fronts. Google began <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">testing PQC in Chrome in 2016</a> and has been <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/why-google-now-uses-post-quantum-cryptography-for-internal-comms?e=48754805">using PQC to protect internal communications</a> since 2022. In May 2024, <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/advancing-our-amazing-bet-on-asymmetric.html">Chrome enabled ML-KEM by default</a> for TLS 1.3 and QUIC on desktop. ML-KEM is also enabled on Google servers. Connections between Chrome Desktop and Google's products, such as Cloud Console or Gmail, are already experimentally protected with post-quantum key exchange.
</p>
<p>
Google engineers have contributed to the standards released by NIST, as well as <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/80492.html">standards created by ISO</a>, and have submitted Internet Drafts to the IETF for <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-trust-expr/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1719337176044717&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GculUbK3_3Hgsv6w-VE-q">Trust Expressions</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1719337176044781&amp;usg=AOvVaw1S2vxLo4QsJsIuaTIYmUy8">Merkle Tree Certificates</a>, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-wiggers-hbs-state/">managing state for hash-based signatures</a>. <a href="https://developers.google.com/tink">Tink</a>, Google's open source library that provides secure and easy-to-use cryptographic APIs, already provides experimental PQC algorithms in C++, and our engineers are working with partners to produce formally verified PQC implementations that can be used at Google, and beyond. 
</p>
<p>
As we make progress on our own PQC transition, Google will continue to provide PQC updates on Google services, with updates to come from Android, Chrome, Cloud, and others.

<title>Keeping your Android device safe from text message fraud</title>

<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/08/keeping-your-android-device-safe-from.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Nataliya Stanetsky and Roger Piqueras Jover, Android Security & Privacy Team</span>

<p>
<a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/cell-site-simulators-imsi-catchers">Cell-site simulators</a>, also known as False Base Stations (FBS) or Stingrays, are radio devices that mimic real cell sites in order to lure mobile devices to connect to them. These devices are commonly used for security and privacy attacks, such as <a href="https://fight.mitre.org/techniques/FGT5012">surveillance</a> and <a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/609.html">interception of communications</a>. In recent years, carriers have started reporting new types of abuse perpetrated with FBSs for the purposes of financial fraud.
</p>
<p>
In particular, there is increasingly more evidence of the exploitation of weaknesses in cellular communication standards leveraging cell-site simulators to inject SMS phishing messages directly into smartphones. This method to inject messages entirely bypasses the carrier network, thus bypassing all the sophisticated network-based anti-spam and anti-fraud filters. Instances of this new type of fraud, which carriers refer to as SMS Blaster fraud, have been reported in Vietnam, France, Norway, Thailand and multiple other countries.
</p>
<p>
GSMA’s Fraud and Security Group (<a href="https://www.gsma.com/get-involved/working-groups/fraud-security-group">FASG</a>) has developed a briefing paper for GSMA members to raise awareness of SMS Blaster fraud and provide guidelines and mitigation recommendations for carriers, OEMs and other stakeholders. The <a href="https://membergateway.sharepoint.com/sites/wg-FASG-FSAG/SitePages/SMS-Blasters-Briefing-Paper.aspx">briefing paper</a>, available for GSMA members only, calls out some Android-specific recommendations and features that can help effectively protect our users from this new type of fraud.
</p>
<h2>What are SMS Blasters?</h2>


<p>
SMS Blaster is the term that global carriers use to refer to FBS and cell-site simulators operated unlawfully with the goal of disseminating (blast) SMS payloads. The most common use case is to leverage these devices to inject <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/what-is/phishing/smishing.html">Smishing</a> (SMS phishing) payloads into user devices. Fraudsters typically do this by driving around with portable FBS devices, and there have even been reports of fraudsters <a href="https://commsrisk.com/bangkok-police-arrest-hong-kong-smishing-scammers-carrying-an-imsi-catcher-backpack-through-shopping-malls/">carrying these devices in their backpacks</a>.
</p>
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfR73BM7TyPriNjm6LveRbEAUVjqtGAXXP4U2FzpRvk1EA63qxYw5Y3sn750rqlB0VwpvNEy0fqniiDOUjXCHHImFHJzZtWm_TjE3MB7W_ICudUMjRvOjcw0C_Vtixr_DwBPLMfX5FJi-43wSFuvnoHXvmm475X4rFf5UtxDrlcQOHvjNTjqrqv93JpNob/s1600/Artboard%201%20copy@2x.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfR73BM7TyPriNjm6LveRbEAUVjqtGAXXP4U2FzpRvk1EA63qxYw5Y3sn750rqlB0VwpvNEy0fqniiDOUjXCHHImFHJzZtWm_TjE3MB7W_ICudUMjRvOjcw0C_Vtixr_DwBPLMfX5FJi-43wSFuvnoHXvmm475X4rFf5UtxDrlcQOHvjNTjqrqv93JpNob/s1600/Artboard%201%20copy@2x.png" /></a></div>
  
The method is straightforward and replicates known techniques to trick mobile devices to an attacker-controlled 2G network. SMS Blasters expose a fake LTE or 5G network which executes a single function: downgrading the user’s connection to a legacy 2G protocol. The same device also exposes a fake 2G network, which lures all the devices to connect to it. At this point, attackers abuse the well known <a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/attachments/1783_101228.27C3.GSM-Sniffing.Nohl_Munaut.pdf">lack of mutual authentication in 2G</a> and force connections to be unencrypted, which enables a complete Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) position to inject SMS payloads.
</p>
<p>
SMS Blasters are sold on the internet and do not require deep technical expertise. They are simple to set up and ready to operate, and users can easily configure them to imitate a particular carrier or network using a mobile app. Users can also easily configure and customize the SMS payload as well as its metadata, including for example the sender number.
</p>
<p>
SMS Blasters are very appealing to fraudsters given their great return on investment. Spreading SMS phishing messages commonly yields a small return as it is very difficult to get these messages to fly undetected by sophisticated anti-spam filters. A very small subset of messages eventually reach a victim. In contrast, injecting messages with an SMS blaster entirely bypasses the carrier network and its anti-fraud and anti-spam filters, guaranteeing that all messages will reach a victim. Moreover, using an FBS the fraudster can control all fields of the message. One can make the message look like it is coming from the legitimate SMS aggregator of a bank, for example. In a recent attack that impacted hundreds of thousands of devices, the <a href="https://commsrisk.com/paris-imsi-catcher-mistaken-for-bomb-was-actually-used-for-health-insurance-sms-phishing-scam/">messages masqueraded as a health insurance notice</a>.
</p>
<p>
Although the type of abuse carriers are uncovering recently is financial fraud, there is precedent for the use of rogue cellular base stations to disseminate malware, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/chinese-trojan-detected-spreading-through-fake-base-stations/">for example injecting phishing messages with a url to download the payload</a>. It is important to note that users are still vulnerable to this type of fraud as long as mobile devices support 2G, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/android-14-introduces-first-of-its-kind.html">regardless of the status of 2G in their local carrier</a>.
</p>
<h2>Android protects users from phishing and fraud</h2>


<p>
There are a number of Android-only security features that can significantly mitigate, or in some cases fully block, the impact of this type of fraud.
</p>
<p>
Android 12 introduced a user option to <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/android-12-release#2g-toggle">disable 2G</a> at the modem level, a feature <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/10/pixel-6-setting-new-standard-for-mobile.html">first adopted by Pixel</a>. This option, if used, completely mitigates the risk from SMS Blasters. This feature has been available since Android 12 and requires devices to conform to Radio HAL 1.6+.
</p>
<p>
  
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3_dR8TI2qfFUh0l4JNScxbSINRIdE0pGvWOfviDTszhVXsYz_vWUsVYhPKFMSzGTFgSfof9noUI8FEQOB2UxHyxxegHMQH-UieKoAw7TqNKvvgcfh8jaaCDmb9HgbUEXyBjXgw_wp7jSjWR32eQdQNq-izO1BlVHhf2fG8AExf_-bjwh0HTxakXJqtNdL/s1600/Artboard%201%20copy%202@2x.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3_dR8TI2qfFUh0l4JNScxbSINRIdE0pGvWOfviDTszhVXsYz_vWUsVYhPKFMSzGTFgSfof9noUI8FEQOB2UxHyxxegHMQH-UieKoAw7TqNKvvgcfh8jaaCDmb9HgbUEXyBjXgw_wp7jSjWR32eQdQNq-izO1BlVHhf2fG8AExf_-bjwh0HTxakXJqtNdL/s1600/Artboard%201%20copy%202@2x.png" /></a></div>
<a href="https://source.android.com/docs/whatsnew/android-14-release#disable-null-ciphers">Android also has an option to disable null ciphers</a> as a key protection because it is strictly necessary for the 2G FBS to configure a <a href="https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FS.35-v3.0.pdf">null cipher</a> (e.g. <a href="https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FS.35-v3.0.pdf">A5/0</a>) in order to inject an SMS payload. This security feature launched with Android 14 requires devices that implement radio HAL 2.0 or above.
</p>
<p>
Android also provides effective protections that specifically tackles SMS spam and phishing, regardless of whether the delivery channel is an SMS Blaster. Android has <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-scam-and-phishing-protection/">built-in spam protection</a> that helps to identify and block spam SMS messages. Additional protection is provided through <a href="https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging">RCS for Business</a>, a feature that helps users identify legitimate SMS messages from businesses. RCS for Business messages are marked with a blue checkmark, which indicates that the message has been verified by Google. 
</p>
<p>
We advocate leveraging a couple of important Google security features which are available on Android, namely Safe Browsing and Google Play Protect. As an additional layer of protection, <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> built-in on Android devices protects 5 billion devices globally and helps warn the users about potentially risky sites, downloads and extensions which could be phishing and malware-based. 
</p>
<p>
Let’s say a user decides to download an app from the Play store but the app contains code that is malicious or harmful, users are protected by <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en">Google Play Protect</a> which is a security feature that scans apps for malware and other threats. It also warns users about potentially harmful apps before they are installed.

<h2>Android’s commitment to security and privacy</h2>


<p>
Android is committed to providing users with a safe and secure mobile experience. We are constantly working to improve our security features and protect users from phishing, fraud, and other threats.
</p>
<p>
Working with global carriers and other OEMs through the GSMA to support the ecosystem in the development and adoption of further cellular security and privacy features is a priority area for Android. We look forward to partnering with ecosystem partners in further raising the security bar in this space to protect mobile users from threats like SMS blasters.

<title>Improving the security of Chrome cookies on Windows</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/improving-security-of-chrome-cookies-on.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/improving-security-of-chrome-cookies-on.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Will Harris, Chrome Security Team</span>

<p>
Cybercriminals using cookie theft <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/a-year-in-the-cybersecurity-trenches-with-mandiant-managed-defense">infostealer</a> malware continue to pose a risk to the safety and security of our users. We already have a number of initiatives in this area including <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/building-security-into-redesigned.html">Chrome’s download protection</a> using Safe Browsing, <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/04/fighting-cookie-theft-using-device.html">Device Bound Session Credentials</a>, and Google’s account-based threat detection to flag the use of stolen cookies. Today, we’re announcing another layer of protection to make Windows users safer from this type of malware.
</p>
<p>
Like other software that needs to store secrets, Chrome currently secures sensitive data like cookies and passwords using the strongest techniques the OS makes available to us - on macOS this is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/">Keychain services</a>, and on Linux we use a system provided wallet such as kwallet or gnome-libsecret. On Windows, Chrome uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI) which protects the data at rest from other users on the system or cold boot attacks. However, the DPAPI does not protect against malicious applications able to execute code as the logged in user - which infostealers take advantage of.
</p>
<p>
In Chrome 127 we are introducing a new protection on Windows that improves on the DPAPI by providing <strong>Application-Bound (App-Bound) </strong>Encryption primitives. Rather than allowing any app running as the logged in user to access this data, Chrome can now encrypt data tied to app identity, similar to how the Keychain operates on macOS.
</p>
<p>
We will be migrating each type of secret to this new system starting with cookies in Chrome 127. In future releases we intend to expand this protection to passwords, payment data, and other persistent authentication tokens, further protecting users from infostealer malware.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How it works</strong>
</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpjkAClX2VvgsIhLi2zAmvRwVMPEeJqUhqisKHIKxbfGAwh8p8-V7Ixct5azzn_jYfJYo2izWnGcbkVh3cabbCLVQQQsJAJagvFPCFJsx4MibauJqnLVymQYdhdGGc53q3wSJSeTPQ6vyxXosJ-tJRKuaaoV7_J_E2KB9glSZ1m3NSEwEBj-duevgROHlM/s1416/Screenshot%202024-07-26%202.15.06%20PM.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpjkAClX2VvgsIhLi2zAmvRwVMPEeJqUhqisKHIKxbfGAwh8p8-V7Ixct5azzn_jYfJYo2izWnGcbkVh3cabbCLVQQQsJAJagvFPCFJsx4MibauJqnLVymQYdhdGGc53q3wSJSeTPQ6vyxXosJ-tJRKuaaoV7_J_E2KB9glSZ1m3NSEwEBj-duevgROHlM/s16000/Screenshot%202024-07-26%202.15.06%20PM.png" /></a></div><p>
App-Bound Encryption relies on a privileged service to verify the identity of the requesting application. During encryption, the App-Bound Encryption service encodes the app's identity into the encrypted data, and then verifies this is valid when decryption is attempted. If another app on the system tries to decrypt the same data, it will fail.
</p>
<p>
Because the App-Bound service is running with system privileges, attackers need to do more than just coax a user into running a malicious app. Now, the malware has to gain system privileges, or inject code into Chrome, something that legitimate software shouldn't be doing. This makes their actions more suspicious to antivirus software – and more likely to be detected. Our other recent initiatives such as providing <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/detecting-browser-data-theft-using.html">event logs</a> for cookie decryption work in tandem with this protection, with the goal of further increasing the cost and risk of detection to attackers attempting to steal user data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Enterprise Considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>
Since malware can bypass this protection by running elevated, enterprise environments that do not grant their users the ability to run downloaded files as Administrator are particularly helped by this protection - malware cannot simply request elevation privilege in these environments and is forced to use techniques such as injection that can be more easily detected by endpoint agents.
</p>
<p>
App-Bound Encryption strongly binds the encryption key to the machine, so will not function correctly in environments where Chrome profiles roam between multiple machines. We encourage enterprises who wish to support roaming profiles to follow current <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7349337">best practices</a>. If it becomes necessary, App-Bound encryption can be configured using the new <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#ApplicationBoundEncryptionEnabled">ApplicationBoundEncryptionEnabled</a> policy.
</p>
<p>
To further help detect any incompatibilities, Chrome emits an event when a failed verification occurs. The Event is ID 257 from 'Chrome' source in the Application log.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
App-Bound Encryption increases the cost of data theft to attackers and also makes their actions far noisier on the system. It helps defenders draw a clear line in the sand for what is acceptable behavior for other apps on the system. As the malware landscape continually evolves we are keen to continue engaging with others in the security community on improving detections and strengthening operating system protections, such as stronger app isolation primitives, for any bypasses.

<title>Building security into the redesigned Chrome downloads experience</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/building-security-into-redesigned.html</link>

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Jasika Bawa, Lily Chen, and Daniel Rubery, Chrome Security</span>

<p>
Last year, we introduced a <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/redesigning-chrome-downloads-to-keep.html">redesign</a> of the Chrome downloads experience on desktop to make it easier for users to interact with recent downloads. At the time, we mentioned that the additional space and more flexible UI of the new Chrome downloads experience would give us new opportunities to make sure users stay safe when downloading files. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Adding context and consistency to download warnings</strong>
</p>
<p>
The redesigned Chrome downloads experience gives us the opportunity to provide even more context when Chrome protects a user from a <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6261569">potentially malicious file</a>. Taking advantage of the additional space available in the new downloads UI, we have replaced our previous warning messages with more detailed ones that convey more nuance about the nature of the danger and can help users make more informed decisions.
</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3gQhfi9Adg__U7OfrbECy8i7-lZIrptsdyyahf0H2Ky5geMifkcYWAxdmNifsoRZiXn4uN5Ybgq2ycO0ZGEmajqLYEjRb5fH52Mw9-swQCxJ5cv67zEt133yYJh651bS5YpUDG9LcAyC5PwG-ZvL1fO2tFXwS91Q5c9V20ms70V6DWe1TJamrZc-NmTid/s2000/RedesignedWarning_inline_7.10.24_V3.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3gQhfi9Adg__U7OfrbECy8i7-lZIrptsdyyahf0H2Ky5geMifkcYWAxdmNifsoRZiXn4uN5Ybgq2ycO0ZGEmajqLYEjRb5fH52Mw9-swQCxJ5cv67zEt133yYJh651bS5YpUDG9LcAyC5PwG-ZvL1fO2tFXwS91Q5c9V20ms70V6DWe1TJamrZc-NmTid/s16000/RedesignedWarning_inline_7.10.24_V3.png" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Our legacy, space-constrained warning vs. our redesigned one</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
We also made download warnings more understandable by introducing a two-tier download warning taxonomy based on AI-powered malware verdicts from <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Google Safe Browsing</a>. These are: 
</p>
<ol>

<li>Suspicious files (lower confidence verdict, unknown risk of user harm)

</li><li>Dangerous files (high confidence verdict, high risk of user harm)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These two tiers of warnings are distinguished by iconography, color, and text, to make it easy for users to quickly and confidently make the best choice for themselves based on the nature of the danger and Safe Browsing's level of certainty. Overall, these improvements in clarity and consistency have resulted in significant changes in user behavior, including fewer warnings bypassed, warnings heeded more quickly, and all in all, better protection from malicious downloads.
</p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPtYz0ba59W8_Orn_Q_viwJ_brTwqLTlZeGwUPAO0IRmuyKWSv4Fxr6Fb34UfBJzHAT0Ydok7JdnPb26t7GxRQD3whlixXbqzrfuFlKYs8DsuH1_Zd3QieU1-RyrGODIrWzJavG-PH0uBchqOFTT51Wgea8uLxTFD_2XHIBy3Vmw77nOmbOIbuqmNq4jOC/s1080/SuspiciousAndDangerous_inline_V2.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPtYz0ba59W8_Orn_Q_viwJ_brTwqLTlZeGwUPAO0IRmuyKWSv4Fxr6Fb34UfBJzHAT0Ydok7JdnPb26t7GxRQD3whlixXbqzrfuFlKYs8DsuH1_Zd3QieU1-RyrGODIrWzJavG-PH0uBchqOFTT51Wgea8uLxTFD_2XHIBy3Vmw77nOmbOIbuqmNq4jOC/s16000/SuspiciousAndDangerous_inline_V2.png" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Differentiation between suspicious and dangerous warnings</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>Protecting more downloads with automatic deep scans</strong>
</p>
<p>
Users who have opted-in to the <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866">Enhanced Protection</a> mode of Safe Browsing in Chrome are prompted to send the contents of suspicious files to Safe Browsing for deep scanning before opening the file. Suspicious files are a small fraction of overall downloads, and file contents are only scanned for security purposes and are deleted shortly after a verdict is returned.
</p>
<p>
We've found these additional scans to have been extraordinarily successful – they help catch brand new malware that Safe Browsing has not seen before and dangerous files hosted on brand new sites. In fact, <strong>files sent for deep scanning are over 50x more likely to be flagged as malware</strong> than downloads in the aggregate.
</p>
<p>
Since Enhanced Protection users have already agreed to send a small fraction of their downloads to Safe Browsing for security purposes in order to benefit from additional protections, we recently moved towards automatic deep scans for these users rather than prompting each time. This will protect users from risky downloads while reducing user friction.

<em>An automatic deep scan resulting in a warning</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<strong>Staying ahead of attackers who hide in encrypted archives</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not all deep scans can be conducted automatically. A current trend in <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/">cookie theft</a> malware distribution is packaging malicious software in an encrypted archive – a .zip, .7z, or .rar file, protected by a password – which hides file contents from Safe Browsing and other antivirus detection scans. In order to combat this evasion technique, we have introduced two protection mechanisms depending on the mode of Safe Browsing selected by the user in Chrome.
</p>
<p>
Attackers often make the passwords to encrypted archives available in places like the page from which the file was downloaded, or in the download file name. For Enhanced Protection users, downloads of suspicious encrypted archives will now prompt the user to enter the file's password and send it along with the file to Safe Browsing so that the file can be opened and a deep scan may be performed. Uploaded files and file passwords are deleted a short time after they're scanned, and all collected data is only used by Safe Browsing to provide better download protections.

<em>Enter a file password to send an encrypted file for a malware scan</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
For those who use Standard Protection mode which is the default in Chrome, we still wanted to be able to provide some level of protection. In Standard Protection mode, downloading a suspicious encrypted archive will also trigger a prompt to enter the file's password, but in this case, both the file and the password stay on the local device and only the metadata of the archive contents are checked with Safe Browsing. As such, in this mode, users are still protected as long as Safe Browsing had previously seen and categorized the malware.
</p>
<p>
The Chrome Security team works closely with Safe Browsing, Google's <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/">Threat Analysis Group</a>, and security researchers from around the world to gain insights into the techniques attackers are using. Using these insights, we are constantly adapting our product strategy to stay ahead of attackers and to keep users safe while downloading files in Chrome. We look forward to sharing more in the future!

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Chrome Root Program, Chrome Security Team</span>

<p>
<em><b>Update (07/22/2024): </b>Website operators who will be impacted by the upcoming change in Chrome for new TLS certificates issued after October 31, 2024 can explore continuity options offered by Entrust. Entrust has expressed its commitment to continuing to support customer needs, and is best positioned to describe the available options for website operators. Learn more at Entrust’s <a href="https://www.entrust.com/tls-certificate-information-center">TLS Certificate Information Center</a>.</em>
</p>

    

<p>
The Chrome Security Team prioritizes the security and privacy of Chrome’s users, and we are unwilling to compromise on these values.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/">Chrome Root Program Policy</a> states that CA certificates included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a> must provide value to Chrome end users that exceeds the risk of their continued inclusion. It also describes many of the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/#7-reporting-and-responding-to-incidents">factors</a> we consider significant when CA Owners disclose and respond to incidents. When things don’t go right, we expect CA Owners to commit to meaningful and demonstrable change resulting in evidenced continuous improvement.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past several years, publicly disclosed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?o2=greaterthaneq&amp;short_desc_type=casesubstring&amp;o1=notequals&amp;v1=Graveyard&amp;classification=Client%20Software&amp;classification=Developer%20Infrastructure&amp;classification=Components&amp;classification=Server%20Software&amp;classification=Other&amp;classification=Graveyard&amp;v2=2015-11-01&amp;f1=classification&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED&amp;short_desc=Entrust&amp;f2=creation_ts&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;list_id=17064895">incident reports</a> highlighted a pattern of concerning behaviors by Entrust that fall short of the above expectations, and has eroded confidence in their competence, reliability, and integrity as a publicly-trusted CA Owner. 
</p>
<p>
In response to the above concerns and to preserve the integrity of the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/how-chrome-root-program-keeps-users-safe.html#:~:text=Chrome%20uses%20digital,the%20%E2%80%9CWeb%20PKI.%E2%80%9D">Web PKI</a> ecosystem, Chrome will take the following actions.

<p>
Additionally, should a Chrome user or enterprise <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#Does-the-Chrome-Certificate-Verifier-consider-local-trust-decisions">explicitly trust</a> any of the above certificates on a platform and version of Chrome <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#when-did-these-features-land">relying</a> on the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a> (e.g., explicit trust is conveyed through a Group Policy Object on Windows), the SCT-based constraints described above will be overridden and certificates will function as they do today.  
</p>
<p>
To further minimize risk of disruption, website operators are encouraged to review the “Frequently Asked Questions" listed below.
</p>
<h3><strong>Why is Chrome taking action?</strong></h3>


<p>
Certification Authorities (CAs) serve a privileged and trusted role on the Internet that underpin encrypted connections between browsers and websites. With this tremendous responsibility comes an expectation of adhering to reasonable and consensus-driven security and compliance expectations, including those defined by the CA/Browser TLS Baseline Requirements.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past six years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports. When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the Internet ecosystem, it is our opinion that Chrome’s continued trust in Entrust is no longer justified. 
</p>
<h3><strong>When will this action happen?</strong></h3>


<p>
Blocking action will begin on approximately November 1, 2024, affecting certificates issued at that point or later.
</p>
<p>
Blocking action will occur in Versions of <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule">Chrome 127</a> and greater on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Android, and Linux. Apple policies prevent the Chrome Certificate Verifier and corresponding Chrome Root Store from being used on Chrome for iOS.
</p>
<h3><strong>What is the user impact of this action?</strong></h3>


<p>
By default, Chrome users in the above populations who navigate to a website serving a certificate issued by Entrust or AffirmTrust after October 31, 2024 will see a full page interstitial <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/">similar to this one</a>.
</p>
<p>
Certificates issued by other CAs are not impacted by this action.
</p>
<h3><strong>How can a website operator tell if their website is affected?</strong></h3>


<p>
Website operators can determine if they are affected by this issue by using the Chrome Certificate Viewer.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use the Chrome Certificate Viewer</span>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Navigate to a website (e.g., <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>)

</li><li>Click the “Tune" icon

</li><li>Click “Connection is Secure" 

</li><li>Click “Certificate is Valid" (the Chrome Certificate Viewer will open) 
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Website owner action is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span> contain “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
 
</li><li><strong>Website owner action is required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading contains “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
</ul>
<h3><strong>What does an affected website operator do?</strong></h3>


<p>
We recommend that affected website operators transition to a new publicly-trusted CA Owner as soon as reasonably possible. To avoid adverse website user impact, action <strong>must</strong> be completed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the existing certificate(s) expire if expiry is planned to take place <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> October 31, 2024. 
</p>
<p>
While website operators could delay the impact of blocking action by choosing to collect and install a new TLS certificate issued from Entrust before Chrome’s blocking action begins on November 1, 2024, website operators will inevitably need to collect and install a new TLS certificate from one of the many other CAs included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a>.
</p>
<h3><strong>Can I test these changes before they take effect?</strong></h3>


<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p>
A command-line flag was added beginning in Chrome 128 (available in Canary/Dev at the time of this post’s publication) that allows administrators and power users to simulate the effect of an SCTNotAfter distrust constraint as described in this blog post FAQ.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to: Simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust</span></p><p>1. Close all open versions of Chrome</p><p>2. Start Chrome using the following command-line flag, substituting variables described below with actual values</p>

<div class="code">
--test-crs-constraints=$[Comma Separated List of Trust Anchor Certificate SHA256 Hashes]:sctnotafter=$[epoch_timestamp]
</div><p>

</p><p>3. Evaluate the effects of the flag with test websites&nbsp;</p><p><b>Example:</b>&nbsp;The following command will simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust with an effective date of April 30, 2024 11:59:59 PM GMT for all of the Entrust trust anchors included in the Chrome Root Store. The expected behavior is that any website whose certificate is issued before the enforcement date/timestamp will function in Chrome, and all issued after will display an interstitial.</p><p>

</p><h3><strong>I use Entrust certificates for my internal enterprise network, do I need to do anything?</strong></h3><p>
Beginning in Chrome 127, enterprises can override Chrome Root Store constraints like those described for Entrust in this blog post by installing the corresponding root CA certificate as a <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#Does-the-Chrome-Certificate-Verifier-consider-local-trust-decisions">locally-trusted root</a> on the platform Chrome is running (e.g., installed in the Microsoft Certificate Store as a Trusted Root CA).
</p><h3><strong>How do enterprises add a CA as locally-trusted?</strong></h3><p>
Customer organizations should defer to platform provider guidance. 
</p><h3><strong>What about other Google products?</strong></h3><p>
Other Google product team updates may be made available in the future.</p><p></p><p></p>

To this end we are excited to announce the launch of kvmCTF, a vulnerability reward program (VRP) for the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor first announced in</span><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/expanding-our-exploit-reward-program-to.html"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="color: black; font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> October</span></a><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> 2023.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">KVM is a robust hypervisor with over 15 years of open-source development and is widely used throughout the consumer and enterprise landscape, including platforms such as Android and Google Cloud. Google is an active contributor to the project and we designed kvmCTF as a collaborative way to help identify &amp; remediate vulnerabilities and further harden this fundamental security boundary.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Similar to </span><a href="https://google.github.io/security-research/kernelctf/rules"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">kernelCTF</span></a><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">, kvmCTF is a vulnerability reward program designed to help identify and address vulnerabilities in the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It offers a lab environment where participants can log in and utilize their exploits to obtain flags. Significantly, in kvmCTF the focus is on zero day vulnerabilities and as a result, we will not be rewarding exploits that use n-days vulnerabilities. Details regarding the&nbsp; zero day vulnerability will be shared with Google after an upstream patch is released to ensure that Google obtains them at the same time as the rest of the open-source community.&nbsp; Additionally, kvmCTF uses the Google </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/bare-metal?hl=en"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Bare Metal Solution</span></a><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> (BMS) environment to host its infrastructure. Finally, given how critical a hypervisor is to overall system security, kvmCTF will reward various levels of vulnerabilities up to and including code execution and VM escape.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">How it works</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The environment consists of a bare metal host running a single guest VM. Participants will be able to reserve time slots to access the guest VM and attempt to perform a guest-to-host attack. The goal of the attack must be to exploit a zero day vulnerability in the KVM subsystem of the host kernel. If successful, the attacker will obtain a flag that proves their accomplishment in exploiting the vulnerability. The severity of the attack will determine the reward amount, which will be based on the reward tier system explained below. All reports will be thoroughly evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The rewards tiers are the following:</span></p><ul style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Full VM escape: $250,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Arbitrary memory write: $100,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Arbitrary memory read: $50,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Relative memory write: $50,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Denial of service: $20,000</span></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Relative memory read: $10,000</span></p></li></ul><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 10.5pt; vertical-align: baseline;">To facilitate the relative memory write/read tiers and partly the denial of service, kvmCTF offers the option of using a host with KASAN enabled.

That’s why we have a team whose only job is to focus on keeping you safe as you install and take advantage of Chrome extensions. Our team:<br />
</p>
<ul>

<li>Provides you with a personalized summary of the extensions you’ve installed

</li><li>Reviews extensions before they’re published on the Chrome Web Store

</li><li>Continuously monitors extensions after they’re published
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">A summary of your extensions</h3>


<p>
The top of the extensions page (chrome://extensions) warns you of any extensions you have installed that might pose a security risk. (If you don’t see a warning panel, you probably don’t have any extensions you need to worry about.) The panel includes:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Extensions suspected of including malware

</li><li>Extensions that violate Chrome Web Store policies

</li><li>Extensions that have been unpublished by a developer, which might indicate that an extension is no longer supported

</li><li>Extensions that aren’t from the <a href="chromewebstore.google.com/">Chrome Web Store</a>

</li><li>Extensions that haven’t published what they do with data they collect and other privacy practices  
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You’ll get notified when Chrome’s Safety Check has recommendations for you or you can check on your own by running Safety Check. Just type “run safety check” in Chrome’s address bar and select the corresponding shortcut: “Go to Chrome safety check.”</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGnX_FKYFwb8VZZcQnZ3-XBpz2N_7yicx-E6FYd0gPL2-WtKiKStwT6-9h-i6y-wlxaFuCriKKNceyRJxSIBkP4V2b0-rk-TK0C9XNxivbsUmpJe3o7TCrlAlKS2eO39XDVePBHjwjI9AqOnCcs-X7qiiFL3wfozInqP5FxGs4dykCva0QObfrWxAqd2g5/s1920/PS_Extension-Review-Panel_V3.gif" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGnX_FKYFwb8VZZcQnZ3-XBpz2N_7yicx-E6FYd0gPL2-WtKiKStwT6-9h-i6y-wlxaFuCriKKNceyRJxSIBkP4V2b0-rk-TK0C9XNxivbsUmpJe3o7TCrlAlKS2eO39XDVePBHjwjI9AqOnCcs-X7qiiFL3wfozInqP5FxGs4dykCva0QObfrWxAqd2g5/s16000/PS_Extension-Review-Panel_V3.gif" /></a></div>

</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Besides the Safety Check, you can visit the extensions page directly in a number of ways:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Navigate to chrome://extensions

</li><li>Click the puzzle icon and choose “Manage extensions”

</li><li>Click the More choices menu and choose menu &gt; Extensions &gt; Manage Extensions
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Reviewing extensions before they’re published</h3>


<p>
Before an extension is even accessible to install from the Chrome Web Store, we have two levels of verification to ensure an extension is safe:
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>An automated review</strong>: Each extension gets examined by our machine-learning systems to spot possible violations or suspicious behavior.

</li><li><strong>A human review</strong>: Next, a team member examines the images, descriptions, and public policies of each extension. Depending on the results of both the automated and manual review, we may perform an even deeper and more thorough review of the code. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This review process weeds out the overwhelming majority of bad extensions before they even get published. In 2024, less than 1% of all installs from the Chrome Web Store were found to include malware. We're proud of this record and yet some bad extensions still get through, which is why we also monitor published extensions.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Monitoring published extensions</h3>


<p>
The same Chrome team that reviews extensions before they get published also reviews extensions that are already on the Chrome Web Store. And just like the pre-check, this monitoring includes both human and machine reviews. We also work closely with trusted security researchers outside of Google, and even pay researchers who report possible threats to Chrome users through our <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5878023369523200/developer-data-protection-reward-program-rules#chrome-extensions">Developer Data Protection Rewards Program</a>.
</p>
<p>
What about extensions that get updated over time, or are programmed to execute malicious code at a later date? Our systems monitor for that as well, by periodically reviewing what extensions are actually doing and comparing that to the stated objectives defined by each extension in the Chrome Web Store.
</p>
<p>
If the team finds that an extension poses a severe risk to Chrome users, it’s immediately remove from the Chrome Web Store and the extension gets disabled on all browsers that have it installed.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5EZOqvRh5BCBErZ6qEN2pXYDPjbCUXL8VmMKCXo-Hz57cfx9yMD97oCmoZ2qpHOGM-3rAPkoStj458SJLdFSz2lNKq6ggIsbb31Paa2uEK_j1YsHlJVnk0wWkRRxQpYjAKWHkldOktUBtVLLogyHg40TTt4SdqY4aQFit9PhYdDT6RJrgwrW0xN5vNeZg/s2000/Chrome_Privacy-Sandbox_Extensions-Safety-Blog-In-line-Asset-1.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5EZOqvRh5BCBErZ6qEN2pXYDPjbCUXL8VmMKCXo-Hz57cfx9yMD97oCmoZ2qpHOGM-3rAPkoStj458SJLdFSz2lNKq6ggIsbb31Paa2uEK_j1YsHlJVnk0wWkRRxQpYjAKWHkldOktUBtVLLogyHg40TTt4SdqY4aQFit9PhYdDT6RJrgwrW0xN5vNeZg/s16000/Chrome_Privacy-Sandbox_Extensions-Safety-Blog-In-line-Asset-1.png" /></a></div><p style="text-align: center;"><i>The extensions page highlights when you have a potentially unsafe extension downloaded</i></p>



<div class="code">
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Others steps you can take to stay safe</h3><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">Review new extensions before installing them</h2>


<p>
The Chrome Web Store provides useful information about each extension and its developer. The following information should help you decide whether it’s safe to install an extension: 
</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/find-great-extensions-new-chrome-web-store-badges/">Verified and featured badges</a> are awarded by the Chrome team to extensions that follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design

</li><li>Ratings and reviews from our users

</li><li>Information about the developer

</li><li>Privacy practices, including information about how an extension handles your data
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Be careful of sites that try to quickly persuade you to install extensions, especially if the site has little in common with the extension.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Review extensions you’ve already installed</h2>


<p>
Even though Safety Check and your Extensions page (chrome://extensions) warn you of extensions that might pose a risk, it’s still a good idea to review your extensions from time to time. 
</p>
<ol>

<li>Uninstall extensions that you no longer use.

</li><li>Review the description of an extension in the Chrome Web Store, considering the extension’s ratings, reviews, and privacy practices — reviews can change over time.

</li><li>Compare an extension’s stated goals with 1) the permissions requested by an extension and 2) the privacy practices published by the extension. If requested permissions don’t align with stated goals, consider uninstalling the extension.

</li><li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en">Limit the sites</a> an extension has permission to work on. 
</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Enable Enhanced Protection</h2>


<p>
The Enhanced protection mode of Safe Browsing is Chrome’s <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/enhanced-protection-strongest-level-of.html">highest level of protection</a> that we offer. Not only does this mode provide you with the best protections against phishing and malware, but it also provides additional features targeted to keep you safe against potentially harmful extensions. Threats are constantly evolving and Safe Browsing’s Enhanced protection mode is the best way to ensure that you have the most advanced security features in Chrome. This can be enabled from the Safe Browsing settings page in Chrome (chrome://settings/security) and selecting “Enhanced”.

<title>On Fire Drills and Phishing Tests</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Matt Linton, Chaos Specialist</span><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span id="docs-internal-guid-9c0f1859-7fff-df93-49d6-bfa18d56d85f"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">In the late 19th and early 20th century, a series of catastrophic fires in short succession led an outraged public to demand action from the budding fire protection industry. Among the experts, one initial focus was on “Fire Evacuation Tests”. The earliest of these tests focused on individual performance and tested occupants on their evacuation speed, sometimes performing the tests “by surprise” as though the fire drill were a real fire. These early tests were more likely to result in injuries to the test-takers than any improvement in survivability. It wasn’t until introducing better protective engineering - wider doors, push bars at exits, firebreaks in construction, lighted exit signs, and so on - that survival rates from building fires began to improve.

However, there’s no need to make this adversarial, and we don’t gain anything by “catching” people “failing” at the task. Let's stop engaging in the same old failed protections and follow the lead of more mature industries, such as Fire Protection, which has faced these problems before and already settled on a balanced approach.&nbsp;</span></p></span></div>

<title>I/O 2024: What’s new in Android security and privacy</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/05/io-2024-whats-new-in-android-security.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/05/io-2024-whats-new-in-android-security.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Dave Kleidermacher, VP Engineering, Android Security and Privacy</span>


<p>
Our commitment to user safety is a top priority for Android. We’ve been consistently working to stay ahead of the world’s scammers, fraudsters and bad actors. And as their tactics evolve in sophistication and scale, we continually adapt and enhance our advanced security features and AI-powered protections to help keep Android users safe. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to our new suite of advanced <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-theft-protection">theft protection features</a> to help keep your device and data safe in the case of theft, we’re also focusing increasingly on providing additional protections against mobile financial fraud and scams. <br />
</p>
<p>
Today, we’re announcing more new fraud and scam protection features coming in Android 15 and Google Play services updates later this year to help better protect users around the world. We’re also sharing new tools and policies to help developers build safer apps and keep their users safe.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Google Play Protect live threat detection</strong>
</p>
<p>
Google Play Protect now scans 200 billion Android apps daily, helping keep more than 3 billion users safe from malware. We are expanding Play Protect’s on-device AI capabilities with Google Play Protect live threat detection to improve fraud and abuse detection against apps that try to cloak their actions. 
</p>
<p>
With live threat detection, Google Play Protect’s on-device AI will analyze additional behavioral signals related to the use of sensitive permissions and interactions with other apps and services. If suspicious behavior is discovered, Google Play Protect can send the app to Google for additional review and then warn users or disable the app if malicious behavior is confirmed. The detection of suspicious behavior is done on device in a privacy preserving way through Private Compute Core, which allows us to <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/trust-in-transparency-private-compute.html">protect users without collecting data</a>. Google Pixel, Honor, Lenovo, Nothing, OnePlus, Oppo, Sharp, Transsion, and other manufacturers are deploying live threat detection later this year.

We’re also bringing additional protections to fight fraud and scams in Android 15 with two key enhancements to safeguard your information and privacy from bad apps:

<li><strong>Protecting One-time Passwords from Malware:</strong> With the exception of a few types of apps, such as wearable companion apps, one-time passwords are now hidden from notifications, closing a common attack vector for fraud and spyware. 

<li><strong>Expanded Restricted Settings</strong>: To help protect more sensitive permissions that are commonly abused by fraudsters, we’re expanding Android 13’s <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/12623953?hl=en">restricted settings</a>, which require additional user approval to enable permissions when installing an app from an Internet-sideloading source (web browsers, messaging apps or file managers).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We are continuing to develop new, AI-powered protections, like the <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/google-ai-android-update-io-2024">scam call detection capability</a> that we’re testing, which uses on-device Gemini-Nano AI to warn users in real-time when it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with fraud and scams. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Protecting against screen-sharing social engineering attacks<br /></strong><br />We’re also tightening controls for screen sharing in Android 15 to limit social engineering attacks that try to view your screen and steal information, while introducing new safeguards to further shield your sensitive information: 
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Automatically Hidden Notifications and One-time Passwords (OTPs):</strong> During screen sharing, private notification content will be hidden, preventing remote viewers from seeing details in a user's notifications. Apps that post OTPs in notifications will be automatically protected from remote viewers when you’re screen sharing, helping thwart attempts to steal sensitive data. 

<li><strong>Safer Logins: </strong>Your screen will be hidden when you enter credentials like usernames, passwords and credit card numbers during a screen-share session.

<li><strong>Choose What You Share:</strong> Currently available on Pixel, other Android devices will also have the ability to share just one app's content rather than your whole screen to help preserve your screen privacy.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Having clear content sharing indicators is important for users to understand when their data is visible. A new, more prominent screen indicator coming to Android devices later this year will always let you know when screen sharing is active, and you can stop sharing with a simple tap. 
</p>

<strong>Advanced cellular security to fight fraud and surveillance<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re adding new advanced cellular protections in Android 15 to defend against abuse by criminals using cell site simulators to snoop on users or send them SMS-based fraud messages. 
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Cellular Cipher Transparency: </strong>We’ll notify you if your cellular network connection is unencrypted, potentially exposing voice and SMS traffic to radio interception, and potentially visible to others. This can help warn users if they’re being targeted by criminals who are trying to intercept their traffic or inject a fraud SMS message.

<li><strong>Identifier Disclosure Transparency: </strong>We’ll help at risk-users like journalists or dissidents by alerting them if a potential false cellular base station or surveillance tool is recording their location using a device identifier.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These features require device OEM integration and compatible hardware. We are working with the Android ecosystem to bring these features to users. We expect OEM adoption to progress over the next couple of years. 
</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhvuLLtMUwGfLTp4gmw6f_2_UuhR3KmVAm-2tlwHexRs8qNlntBWGXo9bwggAONKocQXVqB09MoIATqqwwjmpUG5QtgGfgFz-Lc7nVdLgvf3vGPCNN1UlJoF72Bzfy0_-UwfMON2FbMUfPq75ABmlc8JER42jl3xL46J4Xc3kOkArWgDvvSBkn3tqJ5Uv4/s3816/Cellular%20security%20encryption%20warning%20blog.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhvuLLtMUwGfLTp4gmw6f_2_UuhR3KmVAm-2tlwHexRs8qNlntBWGXo9bwggAONKocQXVqB09MoIATqqwwjmpUG5QtgGfgFz-Lc7nVdLgvf3vGPCNN1UlJoF72Bzfy0_-UwfMON2FbMUfPq75ABmlc8JER42jl3xL46J4Xc3kOkArWgDvvSBkn3tqJ5Uv4/s400/Cellular%20security%20encryption%20warning%20blog.png" /></a></div>
<p>
<strong>More security tools for developers to fight fraud and scams</strong>
</p>
<p>
Safeguarding apps from scams and fraud is an ongoing battle for developers. The <a href="g.co/play/integrityapi">Play Integrity API</a> lets developers check that their apps are unmodified and running on a genuine Android device so that they can detect fraudulent or risky behavior and take actions to prevent attacks and abuse. We’ve updated the API with new in-app signals to help developers secure their apps against new threats: <br />
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Risk From Screen Capturing or Remote Access:</strong> Developers can check if there are other apps running that could be capturing the screen, creating overlays, or controlling the device. This is helpful for apps that want to hide sensitive information from other apps and protect users from scams. 

<li><strong>Risk From Known Malware:</strong> Developers can check if Google Play Protect is active and the user device is free of known malware before performing sensitive actions or handling sensitive data. This is particularly valuable for financial and banking apps, adding another layer of security to protect user information.

<li><strong>Risk From Anomalous Devices: </strong>Developers can also opt-in to receive recent device activity to check if a device is making too many integrity checks, which could be a sign of an attack. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Developers can decide how their apps respond to these signals, such as prompting the user to close risky apps or turn on Google Play Protect before continuing. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Upgraded policies and tools for developers to enhance user privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re working to make photo permissions even more private for users. Starting this year<strong>, </strong>apps on Play must demonstrate that they require broad access to use the photo or video permissions. Google Play will start enforcing this policy in August. We’ve updated photo picker, Android’s preferred solution for granting individual access to photos and videos without requiring broad permissions. Photo picker now includes support for cloud storage services like Google Photos. It’s much easier to find the right photo by browsing albums and favorites. Coming later this year, photo picker will support local and cloud search as well.<br /><br /><strong>Always evolving our multi-layered protections</strong>
</p>
<p>
Android's commitment to user safety is unwavering. We're constantly evolving our multi-layered user protections – combining the power of advanced AI with close partnerships across OEMs, the Android ecosystem, and the security research community. Building a truly secure Android experience is a collaborative effort, and we'll continue to work tirelessly to safeguard your device and data.

<p>
Google and Apple have worked together to create an industry specification – <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/">Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers</a> – for Bluetooth tracking devices that makes it possible to alert users across both Android and iOS if such a device is unknowingly being used to track them. This will help mitigate the misuse of devices designed to help keep track of belongings. Google is now launching this capability on Android 6.0+ devices, and today Apple is implementing this capability in iOS 17.5.<br />
</p>
<p>
With this new capability, Android users will now get a “Tracker traveling with you” alert on their device if an unknown Bluetooth tracking device is seen moving with them over time, regardless of the platform the device is paired with. 
</p>
<p>
If a user gets such an alert on their Android device, it means that someone else’s AirTag, Find My Device network-compatible tracker tag, or other industry specification-compatible Bluetooth tracker is moving with them. Android users can view the tracker’s identifier, have the tracker play a sound to help locate it, and access instructions to disable it. Bluetooth tag manufacturers including Chipolo, eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee have committed that future tags will be compatible.
</p>
<p>
Google’s Find My Device is secure by default and private by design. <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-network-security-privacy-protections.html">Multi-layered user protections</a>, including first of its kind safety-first protections, help mitigate potential risks to user privacy and safety while allowing users to effectively locate and recover lost devices. This cross-platform collaboration — an industry first, involving community and industry input — offers instructions and best practices for manufacturers, should they choose to build unwanted tracking alert capabilities into their products. Google and Apple will continue to work with the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> via the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers working group to develop the official standard for this technology.

This post will seek to clarify these topics.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Passkeys and security keys</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Passkeys are an evolution of security keys, meaning users get the same security benefits, but with a much simplified experience. Passkeys can be used in the Google Account sign-in process in many of the same ways that security keys have been used in the past — in fact, you can now </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;">choose </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">to store your passkey on your security key. This provides users with three key benefits:</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Stronger security</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">. Users typically authenticate with passkeys by entering their device’s screen lock PIN, or using a biometric authentication method, like a fingerprint or a face scan. By storing the passkey on a security key, users can ensure that passkeys are only available when the security key is plugged into their device, creating a stronger security posture.</span></p></li></ul><br /><ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Flexible portability</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">. Today, users rely on password managers to make passkeys available across all of their devices. Security keys provide an alternate way to use your passkeys across your devices: by bringing your security keys with you.</span></p></li></ul><br /><ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Simpler sign-in.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;"> Passkeys can act as a first- and second-factor, simultaneously. By creating a passkey on your security key, you can skip entering your password. This replaces your remotely stored password with the PIN you used to unlock your security key, which improves user security.

<title>Detecting browser data theft using Windows Event Logs</title>

<span class="byline-author">Posted by  Will Harris, Chrome Security Team</span>




    


<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Chromium's sandboxed process model defends well from malicious web content, but there are limits to how well the application can protect itself from malware already on the computer. Cookies and other credentials remain a high value target for attackers, and we are trying to tackle this ongoing threat in multiple ways, including working on web standards like
  <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/04/fighting-cookie-theft-using-device.html" target="_blank">DBSC</a>
  that will help disrupt the cookie theft industry since exfiltrating these cookies will no longer have any value.</p>
<p>Where it is not possible to prevent the theft of credentials and cookies by malware, the next best thing is making the attack more observable by antivirus, endpoint detection agents, or enterprise administrators with basic log analysis tools.</p>
<p>This blog describes one set of signals for use by system administrators or endpoint detection agents that should reliably flag any access to the browser’s protected data from another application on the system. By increasing the likelihood of an attack being detected, this changes the calculus for those attackers who might have a strong desire to remain stealthy, and might cause them to rethink carrying out these types of attacks against our users.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>Chromium based browsers on Windows use the DPAPI (Data Protection API) to secure local secrets such as cookies, password etc. against theft. DPAPI protection is based on a key derived from the user's login credential and is designed to protect against unauthorized access to secrets from other users on the system, or when the system is powered off. Because the DPAPI secret is bound to the logged in user, it cannot protect against local malware attacks — malware executing as the user or at a higher privilege level can just call the same APIs as the browser to obtain the DPAPI secret.</p>
<p>Since 2013, Chromium has been applying the CRYPTPROTECT_AUDIT flag to DPAPI calls to request that an audit log be generated when decryption occurs, as well as tagging the data as being owned by the browser. Because all of Chromium's encrypted data storage is backed by a DPAPI-secured key, any application that wishes to decrypt this data, including malware, should always reliably generate a clearly observable event log, which can be used to detect these types of attacks.</p>
<p>There are three main steps involved in taking advantage of this log:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Enable logging on the computer running Google Chrome, or any other Chromium based browser.</li>
  <li>Export the event logs to your backend system.</li>
  <li>Create detection logic to detect theft.</li>
</ol>
<p>This blog will also show how the logging works in practice by testing it against a python password stealer.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Step 1: Enable logging on the system</strong>
</p>
<p>DPAPI events are logged into two places in the system. Firstly, there is the
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4693" target="_blank">4693</a> event that can be logged into the Security Log. This event can be enabled by turning on "Audit DPAPI Activity" and the steps to do this are described
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-dpapi-activity" target="_blank">here</a>, the policy itself sits deep within Security Settings -&gt; Advanced Audit Policy Configuration -&gt; Detailed Tracking.</p>
<p>Here is what the 4693 event looks like:</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Provider Name&amp;equals&quot;Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing&quot; Guid&amp;equals&quot;&amp;lcub&amp;period&amp;period&amp;period&amp;rcub&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;4693&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Version&gt;0&lt;&amp;solVersion&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Level&gt;0&lt;&amp;solLevel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Task&gt;13314&lt;&amp;solTask&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Opcode&gt;0&lt;&amp;solOpcode&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Keywords&gt;0x8020000000000000&lt;&amp;solKeywords&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2015-08-22T06&amp;colon25&amp;colon14&amp;period589407700Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventRecordID&gt;175809&lt;&amp;solEventRecordID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Correlation &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Execution ProcessID&amp;equals&quot;520&quot; ThreadID&amp;equals&quot;1340&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Channel&gt;Security&lt;&amp;solChannel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Computer&gt;DC01&amp;periodcontoso&amp;periodlocal&lt;&amp;solComputer&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Security &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectUserSid&quot;&gt;S-1-5-21-3457937927-2839227994-823803824-1104&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectUserName&quot;&gt;dadmin&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectDomainName&quot;&gt;CONTOSO&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectLogonId&quot;&gt;0x30d7c&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;MasterKeyId&quot;&gt;0445c766-75f0-4de7-82ad-d9d97aad59f6&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;RecoveryReason&quot;&gt;0x5c005c&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;RecoveryServer&quot;&gt;DC01&amp;periodcontoso&amp;periodlocal&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;RecoveryKeyId&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;FailureId&quot;&gt;0x380000&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;
</div>
<p>The issue with the 4693 event is that while it is generated if there is DPAPI activity on the system, it unfortunately does not contain information about which process was performing the DPAPI activity, nor does it contain information about which particular secret is being accessed. This is because the
  <strong>Execution ProcessID</strong>
  field in the event will always be the process id of lsass.exe because it is this process that manages the encryption keys for the system, and there is no entry for the description of the data.</p>
<p>It was for this reason that, in recent versions of Windows a new event type was added to help identify the process making the DPAPI call directly. This event was added to the
  <strong>Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI</strong>
  stream which manifests in the Event Log in the Applications and Services Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; Crypto-DPAPI part of the Event Viewer tree.</p>
<p>The new event is called
  <strong>DPAPIDefInformationEvent</strong>
  and has id 16385, but unfortunately is only emitted to the Debug channel and by default this is not persisted to an Event Log, unless Debug channel logging is enabled. This can be accomplished by enabling it directly in powershell:</p>
<div class="code">
&amp;dollarlog &amp;equals &amp;grave&amp;NewLine   New-Object System&amp;periodDiagnostics&amp;periodEventing&amp;periodReader&amp;periodEventLogConfiguration &amp;grave&amp;NewLine   Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI&amp;solDebug&amp;NewLine&amp;dollarlog&amp;periodIsEnabled &amp;equals &amp;dollarTrue&amp;NewLine&amp;dollarlog&amp;periodSaveChanges&amp;lpar&amp;rpar&amp;NewLine
</div>
<p>Once this log is enabled then you should start to see 16385 events generated, and these will contain the real process ids of applications performing DPAPI operations. Note that 16385 events are emitted by the operating system even for data not flagged with CRYPTPROTECT_AUDIT, but to identify the data as owned by the browser, the data description is essential. 16385 events are described later.</p>
<p>You will also want to enable
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/audit-process-creation" target="_blank">Audit Process Creation</a> in order to be able to know a current mapping of process ids to process names — more details on that later. You might want to also consider enabling logging of
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/component-updates/command-line-process-auditing" target="_blank">full command lines</a>.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Step 2: Collect the events</strong>
</p>
<p>The events you want to collect are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From Security log:</li><p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4688" target="_blank">4688</a>: "A new process was created."
  </li>
</ul>
  <p></p><li>From Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI/Debug log: (enabled above)</li><p></p>
<ul>
  <li>16385: "DPAPIDefInformationEvent"</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>These should be collected from all workstations, and persisted into your enterprise logging system for analysis.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Step 3: Write detection logic to detect theft.</strong>
</p>
<p>With these two events is it now possible to detect when an unauthorized application calls into DPAPI to try and decrypt browser secrets.</p>
<p>The general approach is to generate a map of process ids to active processes using the 4688 events, then every time a 16385 event is generated, it is possible to identify the currently running process, and alert if the process does not match an authorized application such as Google Chrome. You might find your enterprise logging software can already keep track of which process ids map to which process names, so feel free to just use that existing functionality.</p>
<p>Let's dive deeper into the events.</p>
<p>A 4688 event looks like this - e.g. here is Chrome browser launching from explorer:</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Provider Name&amp;equals&quot;Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing&quot; Guid&amp;equals&quot;&amp;lcub...&amp;rcub&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;4688&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Version&gt;2&lt;&amp;solVersion&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Level&gt;0&lt;&amp;solLevel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Task&gt;13312&lt;&amp;solTask&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Opcode&gt;0&lt;&amp;solOpcode&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Keywords&gt;0x8020000000000000&lt;&amp;solKeywords&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2024-03-28T20&amp;colon06&amp;colon41&amp;period9254105Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventRecordID&gt;78258343&lt;&amp;solEventRecordID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Correlation &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Execution ProcessID&amp;equals&quot;4&quot; ThreadID&amp;equals&quot;54256&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Channel&gt;Security&lt;&amp;solChannel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Computer&gt;WIN-GG82ULGC9GO&amp;periodcontoso&amp;periodlocal&lt;&amp;solComputer&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Security &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectUserSid&quot;&gt;S-1-5-18&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectUserName&quot;&gt;WIN-GG82ULGC9GO&amp;dollar&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectDomainName&quot;&gt;CONTOSO&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;SubjectLogonId&quot;&gt;0xe8c85cc&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;<span class="highlight">NewProcessId</span>&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">0x17eac</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;NewProcessName&quot;&gt;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolProgram Files&amp;bsolGoogle&amp;bsolChrome&amp;bsolApplication&amp;bsolchrome&amp;periodexe&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TokenElevationType&quot;&gt;&amp;percnt&amp;percnt1938&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ProcessId&quot;&gt;0x16d8&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CommandLine&quot;&gt;&quot;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolProgram Files&amp;bsolGoogle&amp;bsolChrome&amp;bsolApplication&amp;bsolchrome&amp;periodexe&quot; &lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TargetUserSid&quot;&gt;S-1-0-0&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TargetUserName&quot;&gt;-&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TargetDomainName&quot;&gt;-&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TargetLogonId&quot;&gt;0x0&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ParentProcessName&quot;&gt;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolWindows&amp;bsolexplorer&amp;periodexe&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;MandatoryLabel&quot;&gt;S-1-16-8192&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;&amp;NewLine
</div>
<p>The important part here is the
  <strong>NewProcessId</strong>, in hex
  <strong>0x17eac
  </strong>which is
  <strong>97964</strong>.</p>
<p>A 16385 event looks like this:</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Provider Name&amp;equals&quot;Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI&quot; Guid&amp;equals&quot;&amp;lcub...&amp;rcub&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;16385&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Version&gt;0&lt;&amp;solVersion&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Level&gt;4&lt;&amp;solLevel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Task&gt;64&lt;&amp;solTask&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Opcode&gt;0&lt;&amp;solOpcode&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Keywords&gt;0x2000000000000040&lt;&amp;solKeywords&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2024-03-28T20&amp;colon06&amp;colon42&amp;period1772585Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventRecordID&gt;826993&lt;&amp;solEventRecordID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Correlation ActivityID&amp;equals&quot;&amp;lcub777bf68d-7757-0028-b5f6-7b775777da01&amp;rcub&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Execution ProcessID&amp;equals&quot;1392&quot; ThreadID&amp;equals&quot;57108&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Channel&gt;Microsoft-Windows-Crypto-DPAPI&amp;solDebug&lt;&amp;solChannel&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Computer&gt;WIN-GG82ULGC9GO&amp;periodcontoso&amp;periodlocal&lt;&amp;solComputer&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Security UserID&amp;equals&quot;S-1-5-18&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;<span class="highlight">OperationType</span>&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">SPCryptUnprotect</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;<span class="highlight">DataDescription</span>&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">Google Chrome</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;MasterKeyGUID&quot;&gt;&amp;lcub4df0861b-07ea-49f4-9a09-1d66fd1131c3&amp;rcub&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;Flags&quot;&gt;0&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ProtectionFlags&quot;&gt;16&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ReturnValue&quot;&gt;0&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CallerProcessStartKey&quot;&gt;32651097299526713&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;<span class="highlight">CallerProcessID</span>&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">97964</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CallerProcessCreationTime&quot;&gt;133561300019253302&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;PlainTextDataSize&quot;&gt;32&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;&amp;NewLine
</div>
<p>The important parts here are the
  <strong>OperationType</strong>, the
  <strong>DataDescription
  </strong>and the
  <strong>CallerProcessID</strong>.</p>
<p>For DPAPI decrypts, the
  <strong>OperationType
  </strong>will be SPCryptUnprotect.</p>
<p>Each Chromium based browser will tag its data with the product name, e.g. Google Chrome, or Microsoft Edge depending on the owner of the data. This will always appear in the
  <strong>DataDescription
  </strong>field, so it is possible to distinguish browser data from other DPAPI secured data.</p>
<p>Finally, the
  <strong>CallerProcessID
  </strong>will map to the process performing the decryption. In this case, it is 97964 which matches the process ID seen in the 4688 event above, showing that this was likely Google Chrome decrypting its own data! Bear in mind that since these logs only contain the path to the executable, for a full assurance that this is actually Chrome (and not malware pretending to be Chrome, or malware injecting into Chrome), additional protections such as removing administrator access, and application allowlisting could also be used to give a higher assurance of this signal. In recent versions of Chrome or Edge, you might also see logs of decryptions happening in the elevation_service.exe process, which is another legitimate part of the browser's data storage.</p>
<p>To detect unauthorized DPAPI access, you will want to generate a running map of all processes using 4688 events, then look for 16385 events that have a CallerProcessID that does not match a valid caller – Let's try that now.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Testing with a python password stealer</strong>
</p>
<p>We can test that this works with a public script to decrypt passwords taken from
  <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-extract-chrome-passwords-in-python/" target="_blank">a public blog</a>. It generates two events, as expected:</p>
<p>Here is the 16385 event, showing that a process is decrypting the "Google Chrome" key.</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;16385&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2024-03-28T20&amp;colon28&amp;colon13&amp;period7891561Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;OperationType&quot;&gt;SPCryptUnprotect&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;DataDescription&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">Google Chrome</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CallerProcessID&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">68768</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CallerProcessCreationTime&quot;&gt;133561312936527018&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;PlainTextDataSize&quot;&gt;32&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;
</div>
<p>Since the data description being decrypted was "Google Chrome" we know this is an attempt to read Chrome secrets, but to determine the process behind 68768 (0x10ca0), we need to correlate this with a 4688 event.</p>
<p>Here is the corresponding 4688 event from the Security Log (a process start for python3.exe) with the matching process id:</p>
<div class="code">
&lt;Event xmlns&amp;equals&quot;http&amp;colon&amp;sol&amp;solschemas&amp;periodmicrosoft&amp;periodcom&amp;solwin&amp;sol2004&amp;sol08&amp;solevents&amp;solevent&quot;&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;System&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;EventID&gt;4688&lt;&amp;solEventID&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime&amp;equals&quot;2024-03-28T20&amp;colon28&amp;colon13&amp;period6527871Z&quot; &amp;sol&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solSystem&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;EventData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;NewProcessId&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">0x10ca0</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;NewProcessName&quot;&gt;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolpython3&amp;bsolbin&amp;bsolpython3&amp;periodexe&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;TokenElevationType&quot;&gt;&amp;percnt&amp;percnt1938&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ProcessId&quot;&gt;0xca58&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;CommandLine&quot;&gt;<span class="highlight">&quot;c&amp;colon&amp;bsolpython3&amp;bsolbin&amp;bsolpython3&amp;periodexe&quot; steal&amp;lowbarpasswords&amp;periodpy</span>&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt; &amp;period&amp;period&amp;period &gt;&amp;NewLine    &lt;Data Name&amp;equals&quot;ParentProcessName&quot;&gt;C&amp;colon&amp;bsolWindows&amp;bsolSystem32&amp;bsolcmd&amp;periodexe&lt;&amp;solData&gt;&amp;NewLine  &lt;&amp;solEventData&gt;&amp;NewLine&lt;&amp;solEvent&gt;
</div>
<p>In this case, the process id matches the python3 executable running a potentially malicious script, so we know this is likely very suspicious behavior, and should trigger an alert immediately! Bear in mind process ids on Windows are not unique so you will want to make sure you use the 4688 event with the timestamp closest, but earlier than, the 16385 event.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Steve Kafka and Khawaja Shams (Android Security and Privacy Team), and Mohet Saxena (Play Trust and Safety)</span>

<p>
A safe and trusted Google Play experience is our top priority. We leverage our SAFE (see below) principles to provide the framework to create that experience for both users and developers. Here's what these principles mean in practice:<br />
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>(S)afeguard our Users</strong>. Help them discover quality apps that they can trust.

<li><strong>(A)dvocate for Developer Protection. </strong>Build platform safeguards to enable developers to focus on growth.

<li><strong>(F)oster Responsible Innovation. </strong>Thoughtfully unlock value for all without compromising on user safety.

<li><strong>(E)volve Platform Defenses. </strong>Stay ahead of emerging threats by evolving our policies, tools and technology.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With those principles in mind, we’ve made recent improvements and introduced new measures to continue to keep Google Play’s users safe, even as the threat landscape continues to evolve. In 2023, we prevented 2.28 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in part thanks to our investment in new and improved security features, policy updates, and advanced machine learning and app review processes. We have also strengthened our developer onboarding and review processes, <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-verify-your-developer-identity-information">requiring more identity information</a> when developers first establish their Play accounts. Together with investments in our review tooling and processes, we identified bad actors and fraud rings more effectively and banned 333K bad accounts from Play for violations like confirmed malware and repeated severe policy violations. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, almost 200K app submissions were rejected or remediated to ensure proper use of sensitive permissions such as background location or SMS access. To help safeguard user privacy at scale, we partnered with SDK providers to limit sensitive data access and sharing, enhancing the privacy posture for over 31 SDKs impacting 790K+ apps. We also significantly expanded the <a href="https://play.google.com/sdks">Google Play SDK Index</a>, which now covers the SDKs used in almost 6 million apps across the Android ecosystem. This valuable resource helps developers make better SDK choices, boosts app quality and minimizes integration risks. 
</p>
<h2>Protecting the Android Ecosystem</h2>


<p>
Building on our success with the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/app-defense-alliance-migrates-under-jdf-with-google-meta-microsoft-as-steering-committee">App Defense Alliance</a> (ADA), we partnered with Microsoft and Meta as steering committee members in the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/evolving-app-defense-alliance.html">newly restructured ADA</a> under the <a href="https://jointdevelopment.org/">Joint Development Foundation</a>, part of the <a href="https://linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a> family. The Alliance will support industry-wide adoption of app security best practices and guidelines, as well as countermeasures against emerging security risks.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, we announced new Play Store transparency labeling to <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/more-ways-for-users-to-identify.html">highlight VPN apps </a>that have completed an independent security review through App Defense Alliance’s <a href="https://appdefensealliance.dev/masa">Mobile App Security Assessment (MASA)</a>. When a user searches for VPN apps, they will now see a banner at the top of Google Play that educates them about the “Independent security review” badge in the Data safety section. This helps users see at-a-glance that a developer has prioritized security and privacy best practices and is committed to user safety.
</p>
<p>
To better protect our customers who install apps outside of the Play Store, we made Google Play Protect’s security capabilities even more powerful with <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/enhanced-google-play-protect-real-time.html">real-time scanning</a> at the code-level to combat novel malicious apps. Our security protections and machine learning algorithms learn from each app submitted to Google for review and we look at thousands of signals and compare app behavior. This new capability has already detected over 5 million new, malicious off-Play apps, which helps protect Android users worldwide.
</p>
<h2>More Stringent Developer Requirements and Guidelines</h2>


<p>
Last year we <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/10/announcing-policy-updates-to-support-app-quality-on-google-play.html">updated Play policies</a> around Generative AI apps, disruptive notifications, and expanded privacy protections. We also are raising the bar for new personal developer accounts by requiring <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14151465">new testing requirements</a> before developers can make their app available on Google Play. By testing their apps, getting feedback and ensuring everything is ready before they launch, developers are able to bring more high quality content to Play users. In order to increase trust and transparency, we’ve introduced <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">expanded developer verification requirements</a>, including D-U-N-S numbers for organizations and a new “About the developer” section.  
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/04/giving-people-more-control-over-their-data.html">To give users more control over their personal data</a>, apps that enable account creation now need to provide an option to initiate account and data deletion from within the app and online. This web requirement is especially important so that a user can request account and data deletion without having to reinstall an app. To simplify the user experience, we have also incorporated this as a feature within the Data safety section of the Play Store.
</p>
<p>
With each iteration of the Android operating system (including its robust set of APIs), a myriad of enhancements are introduced, aiming to elevate the user experience, bolster security protocols, and optimize the overall performance of the Android platform. To further safeguard our customers, approximately 1.5 million applications that do not target the most recent APIs are no longer available in the Play Store to new users who have updated their devices to the latest Android version.  
</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>


<p>
Protecting users and developers on Google Play is paramount and ever-evolving. We're launching new security initiatives in 2024, including removing apps from Play that are not transparent about their privacy practices. 
</p>
<p>
We also recently filed a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/04/google-sues-crypto-scammers-allegedly-uploading-fake-apps-android-app-store.html">lawsuit</a> in federal court against two fraudsters who made multiple misrepresentations to upload fraudulent investment and crypto exchange apps on Play to scam users. This lawsuit is a critical step in holding these bad actors accountable and sending a clear message that we will aggressively pursue those who seek to take advantage of our users. 
</p>
<p>
We're constantly working on new ways to protect your experience on Google Play and across the entire Android ecosystem, and we look forward to sharing more.

We estimate that writing a thorough summary can take nearly an hour and more complex communications can take multiple hours. But we hypothesized that we could use generative AI to digest information much faster, freeing up our incident responders to focus on other more critical tasks - and it proved true. Using generative AI we could write summaries 51% faster while also improving the quality of them.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 18pt;"><span face="&quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="color: #4a86e8; font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">Our incident response approach</span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">When suspecting a potential </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/incident-response"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">data incident</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">, for example,we follow a rigorous process to manage it.

In order to mitigate the risks around potential hallucinations and errors, any LLM generated draft must be reviewed by a human. But not all risks are from the LLM -&nbsp; human misinterpretation of a fact or statement generated by the LLM can also happen. That is why it’s important to ensure there is human accountability, as well as to monitor quality and feedback over time.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Given that our incidents can contain a mixture of confidential, sensitive, and privileged data, we had to ensure we built an infrastructure that does not store any data. Every component of this pipeline - from the user interface to the LLM to output processing - has logging turned off. And, the LLM itself does not use any input or output for re-training. Instead, we use metrics and indicators to ensure it is working properly.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #4a86e8; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">Input processing</span></h3><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The type of data we process during incidents can be messy and often unstructured: Free-form text, logs, images, links, impact stats, timelines, and code snippets. We needed to structure all of that data so the LLM “knew” which part of the information serves what purpose. For that, we first replaced long and noisy sections of codes/logs by self-closing tags (&lt;Code Section/&gt; and &lt;Logs/&gt;) both to keep the structure while saving tokens for more important facts and to reduce risk of hallucinations.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">During prompt engineering, we refined this approach and added additional tags such as &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;Actions Taken&gt;, &lt;Impact&gt;, &lt;Mitigation History&gt;, &lt;Comment&gt; so the input’s structure becomes closely mirrored to our incident communication templates. The use of self-explanatory tags allowed us to convey implicit information to the model and provide us with aliases in the prompt for the guidelines or tasks, for example by stating “Summarize the &lt;Security Incident&gt;”.</span></p><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNtXq_pV3yYUzlwKbKFzxQATIAM4iGIQZB0egooDFnYijJSmqLzdEkreuElXv235Nc4mRphPWFckH8ESCP0fBWl_MfoW8SttvPK8-ajMTKPT-e3RQjJmyMdwVxBFrtZc-UiRR0Ucp8yzyavcOnU0RvSSU22tCUQB-xeicCuQaLSVsmVrRdonsLWUwERw33/s12500/GenAI_IncidentInput%20(1).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="443" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNtXq_pV3yYUzlwKbKFzxQATIAM4iGIQZB0egooDFnYijJSmqLzdEkreuElXv235Nc4mRphPWFckH8ESCP0fBWl_MfoW8SttvPK8-ajMTKPT-e3RQjJmyMdwVxBFrtZc-UiRR0Ucp8yzyavcOnU0RvSSU22tCUQB-xeicCuQaLSVsmVrRdonsLWUwERw33/w603-h443/GenAI_IncidentInput%20(1).png" width="603" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;">Sample {incident} input</span></p><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #4a86e8; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">Prompt engineering</span></h3><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Once we added structure to the input, it was time to engineer the prompt.

A human user can then either accept the summary and have it added to the incident, do manual changes to the summary and accept it, or discard the draft and start again.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="border: none; display: inline-block; height: 200px; overflow: hidden; width: 722px;"><img height="200" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeQ4Nzho_ypJByjKzdaIH9AqhR4xlhGfkgMTzF7p3qF9p-KApOXntu9Sjz_KsIhKZHdP6EExvM8ou6MPzcms8jO4FePzvlZAZFBgilMjh19LIcVLCHgKYDXt1-QMEF35AE9YSjpNTyxSBQfDupwnG7dr03RlzNtKB3WAbnKQggNDCjXFrAs1hTkwUuug8jBNA?key=95E2dlHP4kAABdgaHFkWNQ" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;" width="722" /></span></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;">UI showing the ‘generate draft’ button and LLM proposed summary around a fake incident&nbsp;</span></p><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #4a86e8; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></h3><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #4a86e8; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></h3><h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 4pt; margin-top: 16pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #4a86e8; font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">Quantitative wins</span></h3><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Our newly-built tool produced well-written and accurate summaries, resulting in 51% time saved, per incident summary drafted by an LLM, versus a human.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUAZC0qDT3xHFVfVJYqyl2RmJbg8GNilFoB-_aTWtAjTqwcOD4S_VwSCDRpjVZfPu-962yXgHT-KsRrTCEeBj1aRGlsCiKD-VbRgNnJopDn04KVAUEkegbsRi72qWZ6MLci1NBC-u4OCcxpt1Y_03P03qKv33tqnkipyahn6na3EB3ydEWili0N04FCHvf/s12500/GenAI_Graph03.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="447" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUAZC0qDT3xHFVfVJYqyl2RmJbg8GNilFoB-_aTWtAjTqwcOD4S_VwSCDRpjVZfPu-962yXgHT-KsRrTCEeBj1aRGlsCiKD-VbRgNnJopDn04KVAUEkegbsRi72qWZ6MLci1NBC-u4OCcxpt1Y_03P03qKv33tqnkipyahn6na3EB3ydEWili0N04FCHvf/w608-h447/GenAI_Graph03.png" width="608" /></a></div><div align="center" dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 0pt;"><br /></div><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;">Time savings using LLM-generated summaries (sample size: 300)</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The only edge cases we have seen were around hallucinations when the input size was small in relation to the prompt size.

<p>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/reporting-1/">The Reporting API</a> is an emerging web standard that provides a generic reporting mechanism for issues occurring on the browsers visiting your production website. The reports you receive detail issues such as security violations or soon-to-be-deprecated APIs, from users’ browsers from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
Collecting reports is often as simple as specifying an endpoint URL in the HTTP header; the browser will automatically start forwarding reports covering the issues you are interested in to those endpoints. However, processing and analyzing these reports is not that simple. For example, you may receive a massive number of reports on your endpoint, and it is possible that not all of them will be helpful in identifying the underlying problem. In such circumstances, distilling and fixing issues can be quite a challenge.
</p>
<p>
In this blog post, we'll share how the Google security team uses the Reporting API to detect potential issues and identify the actual problems causing them. We'll also introduce an open source solution, so you can easily replicate Google's approach to processing reports and acting on them.
</p>
<h1>How does the Reporting API work?</h1>


<p>
Some errors only occur in production, on users’ browsers to which you have no access. You won't see these errors locally or during development because there could be unexpected conditions real users, real networks, and real devices are in. With the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/reporting-api">Reporting API</a>, you directly leverage the browser to monitor these errors: the browser catches these errors for you, generates an error report, and sends this report to an endpoint you've specified.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>
How reports are generated and sent.
</i></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Errors you can monitor with the Reporting API include:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Security violations: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content-Security-Policy (CSP)</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy">Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP)</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy">Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)</a>

</li><li>Deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated API calls

</li><li>Browser interventions

</li><li>Permissions policy

</li><li>And more 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For a full list of error types you can monitor, see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/reporting-api/#use_cases_and_report_types">use cases and report types</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Reporting API is activated and configured using HTTP response headers: you need to declare the endpoint(s) you want the browser to send reports to, and which error types you want to monitor. The browser then sends reports to your endpoint in POST requests whose payload is a list of reports.

<h1>Google's approach </h1>


<p>
Google benefits from being able to uplift security at scale. Web platform mitigations like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API">Trusted Types</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Fetch_metadata_request_header">Fetch Metadata</a>, and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy">Cross-Origin Opener Policy</a> help us engineer away entire classes of vulnerabilities across hundreds of Google products and thousands of individual services, as described in <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5896512897417216/a-recipe-for-scaling-security">this blogpost</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the engineering challenges of deploying security policies at scale is identifying code locations that are incompatible with new restrictions and that would break if those restrictions were enforced. There is a common 4-step process to solve this problem: 
</p>
<ol>

<li>Roll out policies in <em>report-only mode</em> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only">CSP report-only mode example</a>). This instructs browsers to execute client-side code as usual, but gather information on any events where the policy would be violated if it were enforced. This information is packaged in violation reports that are sent to a reporting endpoint.

</li><li>The violation reports must be triaged to link them to locations in code that are incompatible with the policy. For example, some code bases may be incompatible with security policies because they use a dangerous API or use patterns that mix user data and code.

</li><li>The identified code locations are refactored to make them compatible, for example by using safe versions of dangerous APIs or changing the way user input is mixed with code. These refactorings uplift the security posture of the code base by helping reduce the usage of dangerous coding patterns. 

</li><li>When all code locations have been identified and refactored, the policy can be removed from <em>report-only mode</em> and fully enforced. Note that in a typical roll out, we iterate steps 1 through 3 to ensure that we have triaged all violation reports. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
With the Reporting API, we have the ability to run this cycle using a unified reporting endpoint and a single schema for several security features. This allows us to gather reports for a variety of features across different browsers, code paths, and types of users in a centralized way.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>A violation report is generated when an entity is attempting an action that one of your policies forbids. For example, you've set CSP on one of your pages, but the page is trying to load a script that's not allowed by your CSP. Most reports generated via the Reporting API are violation reports, but not all — other types include deprecation reports and crash reports. For details, see <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/reporting-api/#use_cases_and_report_types">Use cases and report types</a>.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it is common for noise to creep into streams of violation reports, which can make finding incompatible code locations difficult. For example, many browser extensions, malware, antivirus software, and devtools users inject third-party code into the DOM or use forbidden APIs. If the injected code is incompatible with the policy, this can lead to violation reports that cannot be linked to our code base and are therefore not actionable. This makes triaging reports difficult and makes it hard to be confident that all code locations have been addressed before enforcing new policies.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, Google has developed a number of techniques to collect, digest, and summarize violation reports into <em>root causes</em>.<em> </em>Here is a summary of the most useful techniques we believe developers can use to filter out noise in reported violations:
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Focus on root causes</h3>


<p>
It is often the case that a piece of code that is incompatible with the policy executes several times throughout the lifetime of a browser tab. Each time this happens, a new violation report is created and queued to be sent to the reporting endpoint. This can quickly lead to a large volume of individual reports, many of which contain redundant information. Because of this, grouping violation reports into clusters enables developers to abstract away individual violations and think in terms of root causes. Root causes are simpler to understand and can speed up the process of identifying useful refactorings. 
</p>
<p>
Let's take a look at an example to understand how violations may be grouped. For instance, a report-only CSP that forbids the use of inline JavaScript event handlers is deployed. Violation reports are created on every instance of those handlers and have the following fields set:
</p>
<ul>

<li>The <code>blockedURL</code> field is set to <code>inline</code>, which describes the type of violation.

</li><li>The <code>scriptSample</code> field is set to the first few bytes of the contents of the event handler in the field. 

</li><li>The <code>documentURL</code> field is set to the URL of the current browser tab. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most of the time, these three fields uniquely identify the inline handlers in a given URL, even if the values of other fields differ. This is common when there are tokens, timestamps, or other random values across page loads. Depending on your application or framework, the values of these fields can differ in subtle ways, so being able to do fuzzy matches on reporting values can go a long way in grouping violations into actionable clusters. In some cases, we can group violations whose URL fields have known prefixes, for example all violations with URLs that start with <code>chrome-extension</code>, <code>moz-extension</code>, or <code>safari-extension</code> can be grouped together to set root causes in browser extensions aside from those in our codebase with a high degree of confidence.
</p>
<p>
Developing your own grouping strategies helps you stay focused on root causes and can significantly reduce the number of violation reports you need to triage. In general, it should always be possible to select fields that uniquely identify interesting types of violations and use those fields to prioritize the most important root causes.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Leverage ambient information</h3>


<p>
Another way of distinguishing non-actionable from actionable violation reports is ambient information. This is data that is contained in requests to our reporting endpoint, but that is not included in the violation reports themselves. Ambient information can hint at sources of noise in a client's set up that can help with triage:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>User Agent or <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-security/user-agent-client-hints">User Agent client hints</a>:</strong> User agents are a great tell-tale sign of non-actionable violations. For example, crawlers, bots, and some mobile applications use custom user agents whose behavior differs from well-supported browser engines and that can trigger unique violations. In other cases, some violations may only trigger in a specific browser or be caused by changes in nightly builds or newer versions of browsers. Without user agent information, these violations would be significantly more difficult to investigate. <br />

</li><li><strong>Trusted users: </strong>Browsers will attach any available cookies to requests made to a reporting endpoint by the Reporting API, if the endpoint is same-site with the document where the violation occurs. Capturing cookies is useful for identifying the type of user that caused a violation. Often, the most actionable violations come from trusted users that are not likely to have invasive extensions or malware, like company employees or website administrators. If you are not able to capture authentication information through your reporting endpoint, consider rolling out report-only policies to trusted users first. Doing so allows you to build a baseline of actionable violations before rolling out your policies to the general public.<br />

</li><li><strong>Number of unique users: </strong>As a general principle, users of typical features or code paths should generate roughly the same violations. This allows us to flag violations seen by a small number of users as potentially suspicious, since they suggest that a user's particular setup might be at fault, rather than our application code. One way of 'counting users' is to keep note of the number of unique IP addresses that reported a violation. Approximate counting algorithms are simple to use and can help gather this information without tracking specific IP addresses. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog">HyperLogLog</a> algorithm requires just a few bytes to approximate the number of unique elements in a set with a high degree of confidence.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Map violations to source code (advanced)</h3>


<p>
Some types of violations have a <code>source_file</code> field or equivalent. This field represents the JavaScript file that triggered the violation and is usually accompanied by a line and column number. These three bits of data are a high-quality signal that can point directly to lines of code that need to be refactored. 
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it is often the case that source files fetched by browsers are compiled or minimized and don't map directly to your code base. In this case, we recommend you use JavaScript source maps to map line and column numbers between <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-104#authored-deployed">deployed and authored files</a>. This allows you to translate directly from violation reports to lines of source code, yielding highly actionable report groups and root causes.
</p>
<h1>Establish your own solution</h1>


<p>
The Reporting API sends browser-side events, such as security violations, deprecated API calls, and browser interventions, to the specified endpoint on a per-event basis. However, as explained in the previous section, to distill the real issues out of those reports, you need a data processing system on your end.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there are plenty of options in the industry to set up the required architecture, including open source products. The fundamental pieces of the required system are the following:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>API endpoint</strong>: A web server that accepts HTTP requests and handles reports in a JSON format

</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: A storage server that stores received reports and reports processed by the pipeline

</li><li><strong>Data pipeline</strong>: A pipeline that filters out noise and extracts and aggregates required metadata into constellations

</li><li><strong>Data visualizer</strong>: A tool that provides insights on the processed reports
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Solutions for each of the components listed above are made available by public cloud platforms, SaaS services, and as open source software. See the <a href="?tab=t.0#heading=h.8mq1xpwkxy0y">Alternative solutions</a> section for details, and the following section outlining a sample application.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Sample application: Reporting API Processor</h3>


<p>
To help you understand how to receive reports from browsers and how to handle these received reports, we created a <a href="https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/reporting-api-processor">small sample application</a> that demonstrates the following processes that are required for distilling web application security issues from reports sent by browsers:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Report ingestion to the storage

</li><li>Noise reduction and data aggregation

</li><li>Processed report data visualization
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although this sample is relying on Google Cloud, you can replace each of the components with your preferred technologies. An overview of the sample application is illustrated in the following diagram:
</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD_8vdQRYuPLcnfkVozbtRJgPHlvUnh2dWNnnqxke-z1yw0cvB8o8VhqV9zf5tTXK3VM1kbGodegk94CM9sy3Z5h9_wd6ckkQCa_NB-UnmHaJhIbYw7yRxvBqRN9PtTrgX7V7PoO3A8v0WIcjlNR8pdO2rtLVQp66WfAXG3Ta-GZG84pjvxIEJOyPOKwl5/s3146/Diagram.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD_8vdQRYuPLcnfkVozbtRJgPHlvUnh2dWNnnqxke-z1yw0cvB8o8VhqV9zf5tTXK3VM1kbGodegk94CM9sy3Z5h9_wd6ckkQCa_NB-UnmHaJhIbYw7yRxvBqRN9PtTrgX7V7PoO3A8v0WIcjlNR8pdO2rtLVQp66WfAXG3Ta-GZG84pjvxIEJOyPOKwl5/s16000/Diagram.png" /></a></div><br /><p><br /></p>
<p>
Components described as green boxes are components that you need to implement by yourself. <em>Forwarder </em>is a simple web server that receives reports in the JSON format and converts them to the schema for Bigtable. <em>Beam-collector</em> is a simple Apache Beam pipeline that filters noisy reports, aggregates relevant reports into the shape of constellations, and saves them as CSV files. These two components are the key parts to make better use of reports from the Reporting API.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Try it yourself</h3>


<p>
Because this is a runnable sample application, you are able to deploy all components to a Google Cloud project and see how it works by yourself. The detailed prerequisites and the instructions to set up the sample system are documented in the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/reporting-api-processor/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> file.
</p>
<h1>Alternative solutions</h1>


<p>
Aside from the open source solution we shared, there are a number of tools available to assist in your usage of the Reporting API. Some of them include:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Report-collecting services like <a href="https://report-uri.com/">report-uri</a> and <a href="https://www.uriports.com/">uriports</a>.

</li><li>Application error monitoring platforms like Sentry, Datadog, etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Besides pricing, consider the following points when selecting alternatives:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Are you comfortable sharing any of your application's URLs with a third-party report collector? Even if the browser strips sensitive information from these URLs, sensitive information <a href="https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#capability-urls">may get leaked this way</a>. If this sounds too risky for your application, operate your own reporting endpoint.

</li><li>Does this collector support all report types you need? For example, not all reporting endpoint solutions support COOP/COEP violation reports.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Summary</h1>


<p>
In this article, we explained how web developers can collect client-side issues by using the Reporting API, and the challenges of distilling the real problems out of the collected reports. We also introduced how Google solves those challenges by filtering and processing reports, and shared an open source project that you can use to replicate a similar solution. We hope this information will motivate more developers to take advantage of the Reporting API and, in consequence, make their website more secure and sustainable.

<p>
Keeping people safe and their data secure and private is a top priority for Android. That is why we took our time when designing <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-find-my-device/" target="_blank">the new Find My Device</a>, which uses a crowdsourced device-locating network to help you find your lost or misplaced devices and belongings quickly – even when they’re offline. We gave careful consideration to the potential user security and privacy challenges that come with device finding services. <br /><br />During development, it was important for us to ensure the new Find My Device was secure by default and private by design. To build a private, crowdsourced device-locating network, we first conducted user research and gathered feedback from privacy and advocacy groups. Next, we developed multi-layered protections across three main areas: data safeguards, safety-first protections, and user controls. This approach provides defense-in-depth for Find My Device users.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How location crowdsourcing works on the Find My Device network</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Find My Device network locates devices  by harnessing the Bluetooth proximity of surrounding Android devices. Imagine you drop your keys at a cafe. The keys themselves have no location capabilities, but they may have a Bluetooth tag attached. Nearby Android devices participating in the Find My Device network report the location of the Bluetooth tag. When the owner realizes they have lost their keys and logs into the Find My Device mobile app, they will be able to see the <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/14796936?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7651004&amp;sjid=3104889368197014343-NC" target="_blank">aggregated location</a> contributed by nearby Android devices and locate their keys. <br />

<p>
<strong>Find My Device network protections</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br />Let’s dive into key details of the multi-layered protections for the Find My Device network:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Safeguards</span>:</strong> We’ve implemented protections that help ensure the privacy of everyone participating in the network and the crowdsourced location data that powers it.  
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Location data is end-to-end encrypted.</strong> When Android devices participating in the network report the location of a Bluetooth tag, the location is end-to-end encrypted using a key that is only accessible to the Bluetooth tag owner and anyone the owner has shared the tag with in the Find My Device app. Only the Bluetooth tag owner (and those they’ve chosen to share access with) can decrypt and view the tag’s location. With end-to-end encrypted location data, Google cannot decrypt, see, or otherwise use the location data. 
 
<li><strong>Private, crowdsourced location reports.</strong> These end-to-end encrypted locations are contributed to the Find My Device network in a manner that does not allow Google to identify the owners of the nearby Android devices that provided the location data. And when the Find My Device network shows the location and timestamp to the Bluetooth tag’s owner to help them find their belongings, no other information about the nearby Android devices that contributed the data is included. 
 
<li><strong>Minimizing network data</strong>. End-to-end encrypted location data is minimally buffered and frequently overwritten. In addition, if the network can help find a Bluetooth tag using the owner’s nearby devices (e.g., if their own phone detects the tag), the network will discard crowdsourced reports for the tag.<br />
</li> 
</ul>

<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Safety-first Protections</span>: </strong>The Find My Device network protects against risks such as use of an unknown Bluetooth tag to stalk or identify another user, including:  
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Aggregation by default. </strong>This is a first-of-its-kind safety protection that makes unwanted tracking to a private location, like your home, more difficult. By default, the Find My Device network requires multiple nearby Android devices to detect a tag before reporting its location to the tag's owner. Our research found that the Find My Device network is most valuable in public settings like cafes and airports, where there are likely many devices nearby. By implementing aggregation before showing a tag’s location to its owner, the network can take advantage of its biggest strength – over a billion Android devices that can participate. This helps tag owners find their lost devices in these busier locations while prioritizing safety from unwanted tracking near private locations. In less busy areas, last known location and <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7535860">Nest finding</a> are reliable ways to locate items.
 
<li><strong>At home protection.</strong> If a user has chosen to save their home address in their Google Account, their Android device will also ensure that it does not contribute crowdsourced location reports to the Find My Device network when it is near the user’s home. This provides additional protection on top of aggregation by default against unwanted tracking near private locations.
 
<li><strong>Rate limiting and throttling.</strong> The Find My Device network limits the number of times that a nearby Android device can contribute a location report for a particular Bluetooth tag. The network also throttles how frequently the owner of a Bluetooth tag can request an updated location for the tag. We've found that lost items are typically left behind in stationary spots. For example, you lose your keys at the cafe, and they stay at the table where you had your morning coffee. Meanwhile, a malicious user is often trying to engage in real-time tracking of a person. By applying rate limiting and throttling to reduce how often the location of a device is updated, the network continues to be helpful for finding items, like your lost checked baggage on a trip, while helping mitigate the risk of real-time tracking. 
 
<li><strong>Unknown tracker alerts. </strong>The Find My Device network is also compliant with the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/">integration version</a> of the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/google-and-apple-lead-initiative-for.html">joint industry standard</a> for unwanted tracking. Being compliant with the integration version of the standard means that both Android and iOS users will receive unknown tracker alerts if the on-device algorithm detects that someone may be using a Find My Device network-compatible tag to track them without their knowledge, proactively alerting the user through a notification on their phone.
</li> 
</ul>

<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Controls</span>: </strong>Android users always have full control over which of their devices participate in the Find My Device network and how those devices participate. Users can either stick with the default and contribute to aggregated location reporting, opt into contributing non-aggregated locations, or turn the network off altogether. Find My Device also provides the ability to <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/6160491?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7651004" target="_blank">secure or erase data from a lost device</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to careful security architectural design, the new Find My Device network has undergone internal Android red team testing. The Find My Device network has also been added to the <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/6171833274204160/android-and-google-devices-security-reward-program-rules">Android security vulnerability rewards program</a> to take advantage of Android’s global ecosystem of security researchers. We’re also engaging with select researchers through our private grant program to encourage more targeted research.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Prioritizing user safety on Find My Device </strong>
</p>
<p>
Together, these multi-layered user protections help mitigate potential risks to user privacy and safety while allowing users to effectively locate and recover lost devices.
</p>
<p>
As bad actors continue to look for new ways to exploit users, our work to help keep users safe on Android is never over. We have an unwavering commitment to continue to improve user protections on Find My Device and prioritize user safety.
</p>

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Jasika Bawa, Xinghui Lu, Google Chrome Security &amp; Jonathan Li, Alex Wozniak, Google Safe Browsing
</span>
<p>
For more than 15 years, Google Safe Browsing has been protecting users from phishing, malware, unwanted software and more, by identifying and warning users about potentially abusive sites on more than 5 billion devices around the world. As attackers grow more sophisticated, we've seen the need for protections that can adapt as quickly as the threats they defend against. That’s why we're excited to announce a new version of Safe Browsing that will provide real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection for people using the <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866">Standard protection</a> mode of Safe Browsing in Chrome.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Current landscape</h3>


<p>
Chrome automatically protects you by flagging potentially dangerous sites and files, hand in hand with Safe Browsing which discovers thousands of unsafe sites every day and adds them to its lists of harmful sites and files.
</p>
<p>
So far, for privacy and performance reasons, Chrome has first checked sites you visit against a locally-stored list of known unsafe sites which is updated every 30 to 60 minutes  –&nbsp;this is done using <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/08/how-hash-based-safe-browsing-works-in.html">hash-based checks</a>.
</p>
<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_QBMYx1Gz7H8twUQnE1pRiD8H0m2ckUodFJL0ySh23eh8foVsehxwVO9eu_JwL2BRI1LLUSEKFhJZsHx9IqHBzNCanJpKwHS0hNWn_nJL85jL64nQZTFJMqAkKc0KuU0Q6BnKGiAptLQUFSaHF1lZ1JfrBUxufZx8OPdFw1vjgoFhSjvaMSfZSsQXs2cz/s1428/Screenshot%202024-03-13%203.39.50%20PM.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_QBMYx1Gz7H8twUQnE1pRiD8H0m2ckUodFJL0ySh23eh8foVsehxwVO9eu_JwL2BRI1LLUSEKFhJZsHx9IqHBzNCanJpKwHS0hNWn_nJL85jL64nQZTFJMqAkKc0KuU0Q6BnKGiAptLQUFSaHF1lZ1JfrBUxufZx8OPdFw1vjgoFhSjvaMSfZSsQXs2cz/s16000/Screenshot%202024-03-13%203.39.50%20PM.png" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Hash-based check overview</em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
But unsafe sites have adapted — today, the majority of them exist for less than 10 minutes, meaning that by the time the locally-stored list of known unsafe sites is updated, many have slipped through and had the chance to do damage if users happened to visit them during this window of opportunity. Further, Safe Browsing’s list of harmful websites continues to grow at a rapid pace. Not all devices have the resources necessary to maintain this growing list, nor are they always able to receive and apply updates to the list at the frequency necessary to benefit from full protection.
</p>
<p>
Safe Browsing’s <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2020/05/enhanced-safe-browsing-protection-now.html">Enhanced protection</a> mode already stays ahead of such threats with technologies such as real-time list checks and AI-based classification of malicious URLs and web pages. We built this mode as an opt-in to give users the choice of sharing more security-related data in order to get stronger security. This mode has shown that checking lists in real time brings significant value, so we decided to bring that to the default Standard protection mode through a new API – one that doesn't share the URLs of sites you visit with Google.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Introducing real-time, privacy-preserving Safe Browsing</h3>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">How it works</h2>


<p>
In order to transition to real-time protection, checks now need to be performed against a list that is maintained on the Safe Browsing server. The server-side list can include unsafe sites as soon as they are discovered, so it is able to capture sites that switch quickly. It can also grow as large as needed because the Safe Browsing server is not constrained in the same way that user devices are.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, here's what is happening in Chrome:
</p>
<ol>

<li>When you visit a site, Chrome first checks its cache to see if the address (URL) of the site is already known to be safe (see the “Staying speedy and reliable” section for details).

</li><li>If the visited URL is not in the cache, it may be unsafe, so a real-time check is necessary.

</li><li>Chrome obfuscates the URL by following the <a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/urls-hashing">URL hashing guidance</a> to convert the URL into 32-byte full hashes. 

</li><li>Chrome truncates the full hashes into 4-byte long hash prefixes.

</li><li>Chrome encrypts the hash prefixes and sends them to a privacy server (see the “Keeping your data private” section for details).

</li><li>The privacy server removes potential user identifiers and forwards the encrypted hash prefixes to the Safe Browsing server via a TLS connection that mixes requests with many other Chrome users.

</li><li>The Safe Browsing server decrypts the hash prefixes and matches them against the server-side database, returning full hashes of all unsafe URLs that match one of the hash prefixes sent by Chrome.

</li><li>After receiving the unsafe full hashes, Chrome checks them against the full hashes of the visited URL.

</li><li>If any match is found, Chrome will show a warning.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Keeping your data private</h2>


<p>
In order to preserve user privacy, we have partnered with <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/enabling-privacy-on-the-internet-with-oblivious-http">Fastly</a>, an edge cloud platform that provides content delivery, edge compute, security, and observability services, to operate an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9458/">Oblivious HTTP</a> (OHTTP) privacy server between Chrome and Safe Browsing – you can learn more about Fastly's commitment to user privacy on their <a href="https://www.fastly.com/solutions/customer-trust">Customer Trust page</a>. With OHTTP, Safe Browsing does not see your IP address, and your Safe Browsing checks are mixed amongst those sent by other Chrome users. This means Safe Browsing cannot correlate the URL checks you send as you browse the web.
</p>
<p>
Before hash prefixes leave your device, Chrome encrypts them using a public key from Safe Browsing. These encrypted hash prefixes are then sent to the privacy server. Since the privacy server doesn’t know the private key, it cannot decrypt the hash prefixes, which offers privacy from the privacy server itself.
</p>
<p>
The privacy server then removes potential user identifiers such as your IP address and forwards the encrypted hash prefixes to the Safe Browsing server. The privacy server is operated independently by Fastly, meaning that Google doesn’t have access to potential user identifiers (including IP address and User Agent) from the original request. Once the Safe Browsing server receives the encrypted hash prefixes from the privacy server, it decrypts the hash prefixes with its private key and then continues to check the server-side list.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Safe Browsing sees the hash prefixes of your URL but not your IP address, and the privacy server sees your IP address but not the hash prefixes. No single party has access to both your identity and the hash prefixes. As such, your browsing activity remains private.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWX4X0IOWMDxOgv4_2z033z3i327gXtjV0U0eTdW2XRAxKJPp-_oaIplWUUwJBgt-UNvwNnhlHNPz30O26SVDKK1GImmt_-L0qYhMT-P8N00bMv3ufXZw4TxxTQoTOsXUWx7wUNzoQ05AQwdJn9vXMJmBQR-HG3yY1yW09GrvK1XXrF7Awe3mTxTnY9N-1/s2030/Screenshot%202024-03-13%203.41.41%20PM.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWX4X0IOWMDxOgv4_2z033z3i327gXtjV0U0eTdW2XRAxKJPp-_oaIplWUUwJBgt-UNvwNnhlHNPz30O26SVDKK1GImmt_-L0qYhMT-P8N00bMv3ufXZw4TxxTQoTOsXUWx7wUNzoQ05AQwdJn9vXMJmBQR-HG3yY1yW09GrvK1XXrF7Awe3mTxTnY9N-1/s16000/Screenshot%202024-03-13%203.41.41%20PM.png" /></a></div><p></p><p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Real-time check overview</em>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Staying speedy and reliable</h2>


<p>
Compared with the hash-based check, the real-time check requires sending a request to a server, which adds additional latency. We have employed a few techniques to make sure your browsing experience continues to be smooth and responsive.
</p>
<p>
First, before performing the real-time check, Chrome checks against a global and local cache on your device to avoid unnecessary delay.
</p>
<ul>

<li>The global cache is a list of hashes of known-safe URLs that is served by Safe Browsing. Chrome fetches it in the background. If any full hash of the URL is found in the global cache, Chrome will consider it less risky and perform a hash-based check instead.

</li><li>The local cache, on the other hand, is a list of full hashes that are saved from previous Safe Browsing checks. If there is a match in the local cache, and the cache has not yet expired, Chrome will not send a real-time request to the Safe Browsing server.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both caches are stored in memory, so it is much faster to check them than sending a real-time request over the network.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Chrome follows a fallback mechanism in case of unsuccessful or slow requests. If the real-time request fails consecutively, Chrome will enter a back-off mode and downgrade the checks to hash-based checks for a certain period.
</p>
<p>
We are also in the process of introducing an <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/02/optimizing-safe-browsing-checks-in.html">asynchronous mechanism</a>, which will allow the site to load while the real-time check is in progress. This will improve the user experience, as the real-time check won’t block page load.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection means for you</h3>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">Chrome users</h2>


<p>
With the latest release of Chrome for desktop, Android, and iOS, we’re upgrading the Standard protection mode of Safe Browsing so it will now check sites using Safe Browsing’s real-time protection protocol, without sharing your browsing history with Google. You don't need to take any action to benefit from this improved functionality.
</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_2OYwTAxTggg27lIbawjb3dauEA8leW3aXfhYH-_xVjs-b_VASp92zpqARvsUX37tJKY4r6isvOE7KuHzo-PCGrfq-1R5rblAbpH2eDHi1NdWGzMdae43y143xiaYLS5DhKzbq0FEjkadtT0lzktQq2HcjBlAbKykUCn0CyJaQmIjeCV4gY3eVtnWd1q1/s3200/Red%20interstitial.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_2OYwTAxTggg27lIbawjb3dauEA8leW3aXfhYH-_xVjs-b_VASp92zpqARvsUX37tJKY4r6isvOE7KuHzo-PCGrfq-1R5rblAbpH2eDHi1NdWGzMdae43y143xiaYLS5DhKzbq0FEjkadtT0lzktQq2HcjBlAbKykUCn0CyJaQmIjeCV4gY3eVtnWd1q1/s16000/Red%20interstitial.png" /></a></div>
<p>
If you want more protection, we still encourage you to turn on the <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866">Enhanced protection</a> mode of Safe Browsing. You might wonder why you need enhanced protection when you'll be getting real-time URL protection in Standard protection – this is because in Standard protection mode, the real-time feature can only protect you from sites that Safe Browsing has already confirmed to be unsafe. On the other hand, Enhanced protection mode is able to use additional information together with advanced machine learning models to protect you from sites that Safe Browsing may not yet have confirmed to be unsafe, for example because the site was only very recently created or is cloaking its true behavior to Safe Browsing’s detection systems. 
</p>
<p>
Enhanced protection also continues to offer protection beyond real-time URL checks, for example by providing deep scans for suspicious files and extra protection from suspicious Chrome extensions.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Enterprises</h2>


<p>
The real-time feature of the Standard protection mode of Safe Browsing is on by default for Chrome. If needed, it may be configured using the policy <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SafeBrowsingProxiedRealTimeChecksAllowed">SafeBrowsingProxiedRealTimeChecksAllowed</a>. It is also worth noting that in order for this feature to work in Chrome, enterprises may need to explicitly allow traffic to the Fastly privacy server. If the server is not reachable, Chrome will downgrade the checks to hash-based checks.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Developers</h2>


<p>
While Chrome is the first surface where these protections are available, we plan to make them available to eligible developers for non-commercial use cases via the Safe Browsing API. Using the API, developers and privacy server operators can partner to better protect their products’ users from fast-moving malicious actors in a privacy-preserving manner. To learn more, keep an eye out for our upcoming developer documentation to be published on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/">Google for Developers</a> site.

<strong>Android and Google Devices</strong>
</p>
<p>
In 2023, the Android VRP achieved significant milestones, reflecting our dedication to securing the Android ecosystem. We awarded over $3.4 million in rewards to researchers who uncovered remarkable vulnerabilities within Android and <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/new-android-google-device-VRP.html">increased our maximum reward amount</a> to $15,000 for critical vulnerabilities. We also saw a sharpened focus on higher severity issues as a result of our changes to incentivize report quality and increasing rewards for high and critical severity issues. 
</p>
<p>
Expanding our program’s scope, Wear OS has been added to the program to further incentivize research in new wearable technology to ensure users’ safety.
</p>
<p>
Working closely with top researchers at the ESCAL8 conference, we also hosted a live hacking event for Wear OS and Android Automotive OS which resulted in $70,000 rewarded to researchers for finding over 20 critical vulnerabilities!
</p>
<p>
We would also like to spotlight the <a href="http://hardwear.io">hardwear.io</a> security conferences. Hardwear.io gave us a platform to engage with top hardware security researchers who uncovered over 50 vulnerabilities in Nest, Fitbit, and Wearables, and received a total of $116,000 last year!
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5604090422493184/google-play-security-reward-program-rules">Google Play Security Reward Program</a> continued to foster security research across popular Android apps on Google Play.
</p>
<p>
A huge thank you to the researchers who made our program such a success. A special shout out to Zinuo Han (<a href="https://twitter.com/ele7enxxh">@ele7enxxh</a>) of OPPO Amber Security Lab and Yu-Cheng Lin (林禹成) (<a href="https://twitter.com/AndroBugs">@AndroBugs</a>) for your hard work and continuing to be some of the top researchers contributing to Android VRPs!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Chrome<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
2023 was a year of changes and experimentation for the <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp">Chrome VRP</a>. In Chrome Milestone 116, <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/09/use-after-freedom-miracleptr.html">MiraclePtr</a> was launched across all Chrome platforms. This resulted in raising the difficulty of discovery of fully exploitable non-renderer UAFs in Chrome and resulted in lower reward amounts for MiraclePtr-protected UAFs, as <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp/##reward-amounts-for-mitigated-security-bugs">highly mitigated security bugs</a>. While code and issues protected by MiraclePtr are expected to be resilient to the exploitation of non-renderer UAFs, the Chrome VRP launched the <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp/#miracleptr-bypass-reward">MiraclePtr Bypass Reward </a>to incentivize research toward discovering potential bypasses of this protection.
</p>
<p>
The Chrome VRP also launched the <a href="https://g.co/chrome/vrp/#full-chain-exploit-bonus">Full Chain Exploit Bonus</a>, offering triple the standard full reward amount for the first Chrome full-chain exploit reported and double the standard full reward amount for any follow-up reports. While both of these large incentives have gone unclaimed, we are leaving the door open in 2024 for any researchers looking to take on these challenges.
</p>
<p>
In 2023, Chrome VRP also introduced increased rewards for V8 bugs in older channels of Chrome, with an additional bonus for bugs existing before M105. This resulted in a few very impactful reports of long-existing V8 bugs, including one report of a V8 JIT optimization bug in Chrome since at least M91, which resulted in a $30,000 reward for that researcher.
</p>
<p>
All of this resulted in $2.1M in rewards to security researchers for 359 unique reports of Chrome Browser security bugs. We were also able to meet some of our top researchers from previous years who were invited to participate in bugSWAT as part of Google’s ESCAL8 event in Tokyo in October. We capped off the year by publicly <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41482500">announcing </a>our 2023 Top 20 Chrome VRP reporters who received a bonus reward for their contributions. 
</p>
<p>
Thank you to the Chrome VRP security researcher community for your contributions and efforts to help us make Chrome more secure for everyone!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Generative AI<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
Last year, we also ran a bugSWAT live-hacking event targeting LLM products. Apart from fun, sun, and a lot to do, we also got 35 reports, totaling more than $87,000 - and discovered issues like Johann, Joseph, and Kai’s “<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2023/google-bard-data-exfiltration/">Hacking Google Bard - From Prompt Injection to Data Exfiltration</a>” and Roni, Justin, and Joseph’s “<a href="https://www.landh.tech/blog/20240304-google-hack-50000/">We Hacked Google A.I. for $50,000</a>”.
</p>
<p>
To help AI-focused bughunters know what’s in scope and what’s not, we recently published our <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/googles-reward-criteria-for-reporting.html">criteria for bugs in AI products</a>. This criteria aims to facilitate testing for traditional security vulnerabilities as well as risks specific to AI systems, and is one way that we are implementing the<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ensuring-Safe-Secure-and-Trustworthy-AI.pdf"> voluntary AI commitments</a> that Google made at the White House in July.<br />
</p>
<p>
<strong>Looking Forward<br /></strong>
</p>
<p>
We remain committed to fostering collaboration, innovation, and transparency with the security community. Our ongoing mission is to stay ahead of emerging threats, adapt to evolving technologies, and continue to strengthen the security posture of Google’s products and services. We look forward to continuing to drive greater advancements in the world of cybersecurity.<br />
</p>
<p>
A huge thank you to our bug hunter community for helping to make Google products and platforms more safe and secure for our users around the world!

Since then, memory safety risks have grown more obvious. Like others', Google's internal vulnerability data and research show that memory safety bugs are widespread and one of the leading causes of vulnerabilities in memory-unsafe codebases. Those vulnerabilities endanger end users, our industry, and the broader society. We're encouraged to see governments also taking this issue seriously, as with the U.S. Office of the National Cyber Director publication of a </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf"><span style="color: #1155cc; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">paper</span></a><span style="color: #434343; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> on the topic last week.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: #434343; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">By sharing our insights and experiences, we hope to inspire the broader community and industry to adopt memory-safe practices and technologies, ultimately making technology safer.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"></p>

<title>CVE-2024-38213: Copy2Pwn Exploit Evades Windows Web Protections</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class=""><em>Zero Day Initiative threat researchers discovered CVE-2024-38213, a simple and effective way to bypass Windows mark-of-the-web protections leading to remote code execution.</em></p><p class="">In March 2024, Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative Threat Hunting team started analyzing samples connected to the activity carried out by DarkGate operators to infect users through copy-and-paste operations. This DarkGate campaign was an update from a <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/c/cve-2024-21412--darkgate-operators-exploit-microsoft-windows-sma.html">previous campaign</a>&nbsp; in which the DarkGate operators were exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21412">CVE-2024-21412</a>, which we disclosed to Microsoft earlier this year. </p><p class="">The investigation into this campaign directly influenced further vulnerability research into Windows Defender SmartScreen and how files originating from WebDAV shares are handled during copy-and-paste operations. As a result, we discovered and reported CVE-2024-38213 to Microsoft, which they patched in June. This exploit, which we've named copy2pwn, results in a file from a WebDAV share being copied locally without Mark-of-the-Web protections.</p><h2>What is Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)?</h2><p class="">Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It provides added functionality to HTTP, including features such as authoring, sharing, and versioning.</p>





















  
  



<p>Since WebDAV is based on HTTP, WebDAV shares can be accessed through a web browser using the HTTP protocol, for example, at <code>http://10.37.129.2/example_webdav_folder/somefile</code>. When a file is downloaded from a WebDAV share using a browser such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, it is treated the same as any other file downloaded from the web. As expected, the local copy of the file is marked with the Mark-of-the-Web.  </p>
<p>On Windows, users can also access and mount WebDAV shares via UNC paths, such as <code>\\10.37.129.2@80\example_webdav_folder</code>. A user can browse to a path of this form using Windows Explorer. This functions in a similar manner to accessing SMB shares through Windows. When accessing files in this manner, they are handled directly by the Windows operating system and not by the browser.</p>




  <h2>Threat Actors and WebDAV Shares</h2><p class="">Recently, we’ve seen an increase in threat actors hosting payloads on WebDAV shares. This activity has led to the discovery of numerous vulnerabilities abused as zero-days clustered around accessing malicious payloads from WebDAV shares. These include vulnerabilities such as <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36025">CVE-2023-36025</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21412">CVE-2024-21412</a>, with an additional fix from Microsoft in the form of <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29988">CVE-2024-29988</a>. These vulnerabilities center around Mark-of-the-Web bypasses and evading built-in Microsoft protections such as Windows Defender SmartScreen. </p><p class="">As mentioned, WebDAV shares accessed through Windows Explorer are handled by the Windows operating system as opposed to a browser. &nbsp;Many threat actors are aware of the implications of this with regard to Mark-of-the-Web. During our threat-hunting investigations, we uncovered many threat actors deploying an easy method utilizing the Windows search protocol to open WebDAV searches through Windows Explorer.</p>

  <p class="">Using the logic from Figure 1, threat actors can exercise a high degree of control over what the end user sees on the WebDAV share. This is done by crafting a specific Windows search query that only displays those files the threat actor wants the user to see. Furthermore, by utilizing certain file types such as Internet Shortcut (.url) or Shortcut (.lnk), the threat actor may change the file icon to make it appear as if the malicious file is a completely different type. This lures the user into inadvertently executing scripts or binaries.</p>

  <p class="">Under normal circumstances, files served over WebDAV would receive the Mark-of-the-Web and Windows Defender SmartScreen protections.

<p>When a user downloads a file from an untrusted source such as the web, Windows adds the Mark-of-the-Web to the local copy of the file. The Mark-of-the-Web consists of an NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) with the name Zone.Identifier. Within this stream is the text <code>ZoneId=3</code>, indicating that the file originated from an untrusted source.</p>

  <p class="">Unfortunately, threat actors have discovered that Windows does not always handle or properly apply the Mark-of-the-Web to files served over WebDAV. Historically, Windows has treated WebDAV shares more akin to SMB shares, as opposed to HTTP web servers. This can be quite dangerous.</p><h2>Bypassing Mark-of-the-Web Protections with CVE-2024-38213</h2><p class="">Before the release of the Microsoft June security patch, files copied and pasted from WebDAV shares did not receive the Mark-of-the-Web designations. This meant that users might copy and paste files from a WebDAV share to their desktop, and those files could subsequently be opened without the protections of Windows Defender SmartScreen or Microsoft Office Protected View. In particular, this means that there would be no reputation or signature checks on executables.</p>





















  
  






  <p class="">Copy and paste operations are ubiquitous so Windows users need to ensure that they are fully protected from <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clipboard-hijacking-attack/" target="_blank" title="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clipboard-hijacking-attack/">clipboard hijacking</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pastejacking/" target="_blank" title="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pastejacking/">pastejacking</a>&nbsp;, and copy2pwn attacks, especially in light of recent threat actor activity leveraging WebDAV shares for payload deployment.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p class="">The Zero Day Initiative Threat Hunting Team constantly monitors for new and emerging zero-day threats. During our analysis of existing and previous threat actors and APT activities, we often discover new tactics, techniques, procedures, and hidden zero-day vulnerabilities. </p><p class="">This case emphasizes the integration of ZDI threat hunting with proactive vulnerability research within the ZDI program. By combining threat research with the Zero Day Initiative's core vulnerability research program, the ZDI Threat Hunting Team can develop new adversarial models and simulate new attack strategies as they might occur in the real world. This integration enables us to protect and defend customers from potentially hidden attack methods and chains before threat actors can incorporate them into their attack strategies.</p><p class="">We’ll be back with more findings as we have them.

<p class=""><em>If you just want to read the rules, you can find them </em><a href="https://zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnIreland2024Rules.html" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Over the last few years, our consumer-focused Pwn2Own event took place in the Trend Micro office in Toronto. However, that office closed, so we needed to find a new home. This isn’t unusual for this event, as it moved from Amsterdam to Tokyo to Austin to Toronto. We’re moving again. This year, we are heading to our offices in Cork, Ireland! We’re excited about our new location, and I personally have <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/IimtaPyt7uE?feature=share" target="_blank">viewed</a> several locations for after-hours and special events. Some of those will be secret until the competition, but I can tell you that our awards ceremony and end-of-contest party will be held at the historic <a href="https://corkcitygaol.com/" target="_blank">Cork City Goal</a>. It promises to be a fun and spooky event, and we’ll have more details about that in the future.</p><p class="">Beyond our new location, we’re excited to announce <strong>Meta</strong> has joined as a sponsor of this event and will participate in the new Messenger App category. That’s right – <strong>WhatsApp</strong> will be a target, with both 0-click and 1-click exploits being in scope. We’re offering $300,000 USD for a 0-click, so we hope to see some great research on an application used by millions. We’re also excited to announce the return of <strong>Synology</strong> as a co-sponsor of the event and <strong>QNAP</strong> joins them as a co-sponsor. </p><p class="">The Messenger App category isn’t the only exciting thing heading to Ireland. This will be our first competition to feature AI-enabled devices. Both the Samsung and Google phones include <a href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/smartphones/galaxy-s24/?cid=ca_pd_ppc_google_f1h24-galaxy-s24-series_launch_im-hhp-retention_text_rtb_20180102-w-samsung%20galaxy%20s24&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7sPGn7WshwMViG8PAh1PfQdiEAAYASAAEgJoF_D_BwE#:~:text=Buy%20now-,Galaxy%20AI%20is%20here,-Welcome%20to%20the">Galaxy AI</a> and <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/categories/ai/">Google AI</a> respectively. Multiple Synology devices use AI for tasks such as people and vehicle recognition on the cameras and AI-driven photo albums on their NAS devices. The Ubiquiti camera also uses AI for greater detection precision and range. There’s no special bonus for exploiting an AI feature, but it will be interesting to see if AI helps or hurts exploit attempts.</p><p class="">Last year’s favorite category was the “SOHO Smashup”, and it returns for another year. This category challenges contestants by having them start by exploiting the external interface of a router, compromise the router, and then pivot to another device connected to the network. In the Toronto event last year, several teams had winning entries in this category. It’s always amazing to watch the researchers as they pivot through multiple attack surfaces to hit their final goal. We’re also bringing wired and wireless cameras back into the contest under the surveillance category. Last year, we awarded $1,038,500 during the event for 58 unique 0-days. It will be interesting to see if the luck of the Irish will take that number up or down.</p><p class="">As for the contest itself, it will run from October 22-25, 2024. As always, we’ll have a random drawing to determine the schedule of attempts on the first day of the contest, and we will proceed from there. Registration closes at 5:00 p.m. Irish Standard Time on Oct 17th, 2024. There are no exceptions for late entries, so if you have questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:pwn2own@trendmicro.com">pwn2own@trendmicro.com</a> (note the new address). We will be happy to address your issues or concerns directly.</p><p class="">Now on to the specific target categories. We’ll have seven different categories for this year’s event:</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at each category in more detail, starting with mobile phones.</p>
<p><a name="phones"></a></p>
<p><b>The Target Phones</b></p>




  <p class="">Back in Amsterdam where this contest originated, it was originally dubbed “Mobile Pwn2Own” and our focus was strictly on phones. Mobile handsets remain at the heart of this event, and some of the Samsung entries from last year were absolutely smashing. As always, these phones will be running the latest version of their respective operating systems with all available updates installed. You may notice there are no Xiaomi devices in this year’s event. That’s because, during the contest last year, they took measures to ensure attempts would fail. They didn’t seem to mind that those measures impacted all of their users globally. While we do encourage shenanigans, that’s a bit too far to be considered fair. Thus, they are not returning. If you want more details about what happened, be sure to check out Ken Gannon and Ilyes Beghdadi’s upcoming <a href="https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-speakers.html#54454" target="_blank">DEFCON talk</a> about the subject.</p><p class="">In this category, contestants must compromise the device by browsing to content in the default browser for the target under test or by communicating with the following short-distance protocols: near field communication (NFC), Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. The awards for this category are:</p>

  <p class="">The Google and Apple devices in this category also include an add-on bonus. If your exploit payload executes with kernel-level privileges, you earn an additional <strong>$50,000</strong> and 5 more Master of Pwn points. That means a full exploit chain that includes kernel-level access on the iPhone or Pixel will earn <strong>$300,000 </strong>and 30 Master of Pwn points.</p>

<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a></p>
<p><b>Messenger Apps</b></p>




  <p class="">Almost everyone uses some messenger app in their daily lives, and these apps have been the target of sophisticated threats in the past. We’re excited that Meta has agreed to sponsor this event and are hopeful that one (or more) of our contestants will demonstrate a WhatsApp exploit. Both 0-click and 1-click exploits are in scope. All valid submissions must use vulnerabilities reachable via WhatsApp and must not depend on other applications. All WhatsApp entries will be run on a Google Pixel 8.</p>

<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a></p>
<p><b>The SOHO Smashup</b></p>




  <p class="">The proliferation of WFH resulted in many enterprises finding their network perimeter relocated to the home office. Threat actors exploiting home routers and consumer devices can use these as a launch point for lateral movements into enterprise resources. We wanted to demonstrate this during the contest, which means the SOHO Smashup category continues to be relevant. Contestants will need to first compromise the WAN port on a selected router. Once they accomplish that not-so-insignificant feat, they will need to pivot to one of the other devices and compromise it as well. The contestant is free to select any combination of router and home automation hub, smart speaker, printer, or network-attached storage device during the registration process – although you won’t have some of the same easy targets as last year. If they get both devices within 30 minutes, they earn $100,000 and 10 Master of Pwn points. </p>

<p><b>Surveillance Systems</b></p>




  <p class="">Last year, we introduced this category not knowing what to expect. As usual, our contestants did not disappoint as they unleashed some fantastic exploits – including taking over a camera just by showing it a QR code. Cameras continue to be a part of daily life, and we can’t wait to see what research is put on display this year. An attempt in this category must be launched against the target’s exposed network services or the target’s exposed features from the contestant’s laptop within the contest network.</p>

  <p class="">Many of the cameras and other “smart” devices are connected to a centralized hub. From lights to locks to thermostats, cameras, and more, all can be accessed through a home automation hub. Of course, that means a threat actor could potentially access them as well. This year, we’re introducing the AeoTec Smart Home Hub in this category, so we’ll see if our contestants take a run at it. Here are the targets in the Home Automation category:</p>

  <p class="">Printers have long been the source of jokes and memes, but they are also an often overlooked attack surface in your office. The printer category always produces some interesting results, often by playing music it shouldn’t or the occasional Rick Roll. It will be interesting to see what exploits the contestants come up with this year.</p>

  <p class=""><strong>Master of Pwn</strong></p><p class="">No Pwn2Own contest would be complete without crowning a Master of Pwn, which signifies the overall winner of the competition. Earning the title results in a slick <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eyexso3WUAYbXPK?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096">trophy</a>, a different sort of <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1240400682034909187">wearable</a>, and brings with it an additional 65,000 ZDI reward points (instant <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/about/benefits/">Platinum</a> status in 2025).</p><p class="">For those not familiar with how it works, points are accumulated for each successful attempt. While only the first demonstration in a category wins the full cash award, each successful entry claims the full number of Master of Pwn points. Since the order of attempts is determined by a random draw, those who receive later slots can still claim the Master of Pwn title – even if they earn a lower cash payout. As with previous contests, there are penalties for withdrawing from an attempt once you register for it. If the contestant decides to remove an Add-on Bonus during their attempt, the Master of Pwn points for that Add-on Bonus will be deducted from the final point total for that attempt. For example, someone registers for the Apple iPhone 15 with the Kernel Bonus Add-on. During the attempt, the contestant drops the Kernel Bonus Add-on but completes the attempt. The final point total will be 20 Master of Pwn points.</p><p class=""><strong>The Complete Details</strong></p><p class="">The full set of rules for Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 can be found <a href="https://zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnIreland2024Rules.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class=""><em>In this guest blog from Master of Pwn winner Manfred Paul, he details CVE-2024-2887 – a type confusion bug that occurs in both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (Chromium). He used this bug as a part of his winning exploit that led to code execution in the renderer of both browsers. This bug was quickly patched by both </em><a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_26.html"><em>Google</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-2887"><em>Microsoft</em></a><em>. Manfred has graciously provided this detailed write-up of the vulnerability and how he exploited it at the contest.</em></p>





















  
  



<hr /><p>In this blog, I describe a means of exploiting the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine to gain execution of arbitrary shellcode inside the renderer process. This includes a bypass of the V8 memory sandbox (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM4fQmIhEqPG8uGp5o9A-mnPB5BOeScZYpkHjo0KKA8/edit#heading=h.xzptrog8pyxf">Ubercage</a>), though code execution is still constrained by the process isolation-based browser sandbox. For demonstration purposes, this limitation can be removed by running the browser with the <code>--no- sandbox</code> flag. </p>
<p><b>Root Cause of the WebAssembly Universal Type Confusion</b></p>
<p>A WebAssembly module may contain a <code>type</code> section that defines a list of custom “heap types”. In the base specification, this is used only to declare function types, but with the adoption of the garbage collection (GC) <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/gc/core/_download/WebAssembly.pdf">proposal</a> [PDF], this section can additionally define struct types, allowing for the use of composite, heap-allocated types in WebAssembly. </p>
<p>Normally, a struct declared in this section may only reference structs that precede it  (structs with a lower type index). To support mutually recursive data structures, a feature called recursive type groups is available. Instead of declaring the (potentially) mutually recursive types as individual entries in the type section, a recursive group is declared as a single type section entry. Within this group, individual types are declared, which are thereby allowed to reference each other.</p>
<p>With this in mind, consider the function responsible for parsing the <code>type</code> section from the binary WebAssembly format in <code>v8/src/wasm/module-decoder-impl.h</code>: </p>

<p>At (1), the limit <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> (currently equal to 1,000,000) is passed as a maximum to <code>consume_count()</code>, ensuring that at most this many entries are read from the <code>type</code> section. When recursive type groups were added, this check became insufficient. While this code will permit only <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> entries of the <code>type</code> section to be read, each of those can potentially be a recursive type group containing more than one individual type definition. </p>
<p>This insufficiency was clearly noticed at the time of this change, as together with recursive type groups a second check was added at (2). Here, for each recursive type group, it is checked that the addition of the constituent types would not exceed the <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> limit. </p>
<p>However, this second check is still not enough. While it protects the indices of each type allocated inside a recursive group, the presence of those groups also has implications for types declared outside this group, as each recursive group adds to the total count of declared types. </p>
<p>To make this clearer, imagine a type section consisting of two entries: one recursive group containing<code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> entries, and following that group, one non-recursive type. The check at (1) is passed, as the section only has two entries. While processing the recursive group, the check at (2) is also passed, as the section has exactly <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> entries. For the following single type, there is no further check: at (3) the type is simply allocated at the next free index. In this case, the index will be  <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code>, exceeding the usual maximum of <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes-1</code>. If there were more than one non-recursive type at the end of the <code>type</code> section, they would similarly get assigned <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes+1</code>, <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes+2</code>, and so forth, as type indices. </p>
<p><b>Impact of the Root Cause</b></p>
<p>Exceeding the maximal number of declared heap types might seem like a very harmless resource exhaustion bug at first. However, due to some internal details of how V8 handles WebAssembly heap types, it directly allows constructing some very powerful exploit primitives. </p>
<p>In <code>v8/src/wasm/value-type.h</code>, the encoding of heap types is defined: </p>

<p>Here, V8 assumes that all user-defined heap types will be assigned indices smaller than <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code>. Larger indices are reserved for fixed, internal heap types (beginning with <code>kFunc</code>). This results in our own type declarations aliasing one of these internal types, leading to many opportunities for type confusion. </p>
<p><b>Universal WebAssembly Type Confusion</b></p>
<p>To leverage this encoding ambiguity into a full type confusion, let’s first consider the <code>struct.new</code> opcode, which produces a reference to a new struct created from fields given on the stack. The caller specifies the desired struct type by passing its type index. The relevant check on the type index can be found in <code>v8/src/wasm/function-body-decoder-impl.h</code>:</p>

<p>Following the validation logic into the <code>has_struct()</code> method from <code>v8/src/wasm/wasm-module.h</code>: </p>

<p>Since we can make <code>types.size()</code>  exceed the usual limit of <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code>, we can make the check pass even if when passing an index larger than this value. This allows us to create a reference of an arbitrary internal type that points to the struct we can freely define. </p>
<p>On the other hand, consider now the handling of the <code>ref.cast</code> instruction: </p>

<p>Here, a <code>type</code> check elimination is performed. If <code>TypeCheckAlwaysSucceeds</code> returns true, then no actual <code>type</code> check is emitted and the value is simply reinterpreted as the target <code>type</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>TypeCheckAlwaysSucceeds</code> ultimately calls <code>IsHeapSubtypeOfImpl</code> defined in <code>v8/src/wasm/wasm-subtyping.cc</code>:</p>

<p>This means that if our declared type index aliases the constant <code>HeapType::kNone</code>, the type check will always be elided if we cast to any non-function, non-external reference. In combination, we can use this to turn any reference type into any other by the following steps: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>   In the type section, define a structure type with a single field of type <code>anyref</code>, and make this struct have a type index equal to <code>HeapType::kNone</code> using the bug described above. </p>
</li>
<li><p>   Place a non-null reference value of any type on the top of the stack and call <code>struct.new</code> with the type index set to <code>HeapType::kNone</code>. This will succeed, as <code>has_struct()</code> validates the index against the index established via the previous step. </p>
</li>
<li><p>   Also, declare a struct with a normal type index lower than <code>kV8MaxWasmTypes</code> with a single field of the target reference type. Call <code>ref.cast</code> with this  this struct’s type index. The engine will not perform any type check, as the input value is at this point understood to be reference type <code>HeapType::kNone</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>   Finally, read back the reference stored in the struct by executing <code>struct.get</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This arbitrary casting of reference types allows transmuting any value type into any other by referencing it, changing the reference type, and then dereferencing it – a universal type confusion. </p>
<p>In particular, this directly contains nearly all usual JavaScript engine exploitation primitives as special cases:</p>
<p>•	Transmuting <code>int</code> to <code>int*</code> and then dereferencing results in an arbitrary read.</p>
<p>•	Transmuting <code>int</code> to <code>int*</code> and then writing to that reference results in an arbitrary write.</p>
<p>•	Transmuting <code>externref</code>to <code>int</code> is the <code>addrOf()</code> primitive, obtaining the address of a JavaScript object.</p>
<p>•	Transmuting <code>int</code> to <code>externref</code> is the <code>fakeObj()</code> primitive, forcing the engine to treat an arbitrary value as a pointer to a JavaScript object. </p>
<p>While casting from <code>HeapType::kNone</code> to an <code>externref</code> is not allowed, remember that we are actually operating on one more level of indirection - transmuting to <code>externref</code> involves casting to a reference to a struct containing one <code>externref</code> member.</p>
<p>Note however that these “arbitrary” reads and writes are still contained in the V8 memory sandbox, as all involved pointers to heap-allocated structures are tagged, compressed pointers inside the heap cage, not full 64-bit raw pointers. </p>
<p><b>Integer Underflow Leading to V8 Sandbox Escape</b> </p>
<p>The primitives described above allow for freely manipulating and faking most JavaScript objects. However, all of this happens inside the limited memory space of the V8 sandbox. “Trusted” objects such as WebAssembly instance data cannot yet be manipulated. We will now turn our attention to a bug that can be used to escape the memory sandbox.</p>
<p>An often-used object for JavaScript engine exploits is <code>ArrayBuffer</code> and its corresponding views, (i.e. typed arrays), as it allows for direct, untagged access to some region of memory. </p>
<p>To prevent access to pointers outside the V8 sandbox, sandboxed pointers are used to designate a typed array’s corresponding backing store. Similarly, an ArrayBuffer’s length field is always loaded as a “bounded size access”, inherently limiting its value to a maximum of 235 − 1. </p>
<p>However, in modern JavaScript, the handling of typed arrays has become quite complex due to the introduction of resizable ArrayBuffers (RABs) and their sharable variant, growable SharedArrayBuffers (GSABs). Both variants feature the ability to change their length after the object has been created with the shared variant being restricted to never shrink. In particular, for typed arrays with these kinds of buffers, the array length can never be cached and must be recomputed on each access.</p>
<p>Additionally, ArrayBuffers also feature an offset field, describing the start of the data in the 
actual underlying backing store. This offset must be taken into account when computing the length. </p>
<p>Let’s now look at the code responsible for building a TypedArray’s length access in the optimizing Turbofan compiler. It can be found in <code>v8/src/compiler/graph-assembler.cc</code>. Note that most non-RAB/GSAB cases and the code responsible for dispatching are omitted for simplicity: </p>

<p>For arrays backed by a resizable ArrayBuffer, we can see at (1) that the length is computed as <code>floor((byte_length - byte_offset) / element_size)</code>. Crucially, there is an underflow check. If <code>byte_offset</code> exceeds <code>byte_length</code>, then 0 is returned instead. </p>
<p>Curiously though, in the case of a GSAB-backed array, the corresponding underflow check is missing. Thus, if <code>byte_offset</code> is larger than <code>byte_length</code>, an underflow occurs and the subtraction wraps around to something close to the maximum unsigned 64-bit integer 264. As both of these fields are found in the (by now) attacker-controlled array object, we can easily trigger this using the sandboxed arbitrary read/write primitives discussed previously. This results in access to the whole 64-bit address space, as the length computed by this function is used to bound any typed array accesses (in JIT-compiled code). </p>
<p><b>Exploitation for Arbitrary Shellcode Execution</b></p>
<p>Using the two bugs described above, exploitation becomes fairly straightforward. The primitives described in the Universal WebAssembly Type Confusion section directly give arbitrary reads and writes within the V8 memory sandbox. This can then be used to manipulate a growable <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> to have an offset greater than its length. A previously JIT-compiled read/write function can then be used to access and overwrite data anywhere in the process’s address space. An appropriate target for overwrite is the compiled code of a <code>WebAssembly</code> module, since that resides in an RWX (read-write-execute) page and can be overwritten with shellcode.</p>

<title>Crooks Bypassed Google’s Email Verification to Create Workspace Accounts, Access 3rd-Party Services</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/crooks-bypassed-googles-email-verification-to-create-workspace-accounts-access-3rd-party-services/</link>
<guid>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/crooks-bypassed-googles-email-verification-to-create-workspace-accounts-access-3rd-party-services/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Google</strong> says it recently fixed an authentication weakness that allowed crooks to circumvent the email verification required to create a <strong>Google Workspace</strong> account, and leverage that to impersonate a domain holder at third-party services that allow logins through Google&#8217;s &#8220;Sign in with Google&#8221; feature.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68194" height="367" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/signinwithgoogle.png" width="418" /></p>
<p>Last week, KrebsOnSecurity heard from a reader who said they received a notice that their email address had been used to create a potentially malicious Workspace account that Google had blocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last few weeks, we identified a small-scale abuse campaign whereby bad actors circumvented the email verification step in our account creation flow for Email Verified (EV) Google Workspace accounts using a specially constructed request,&#8221; the notice from Google read. &#8220;These EV users could then be used to gain access to third-party applications using &#8216;Sign In with Google&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to questions, Google said it fixed the problem within 72 hours of discovering it, and that the company has added additional detection to protect against these types of authentication bypasses going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Anu Yamunan</strong>, director of abuse and safety protections at Google Workspace, told KrebsOnSecurity the malicious activity began in late June, and involved &#8220;a few thousand&#8221; Workspace accounts that were created without being domain-verified.</p>
<p>Google Workspace offers a free trial that people can use to access services like Google Docs, but other services such as Gmail are only available to Workspace users who can validate control over the domain name associated with their email address. The weakness Google fixed allowed attackers to bypass this validation process. Google emphasized that none of the affected domains had previously been associated with Workspace accounts or services.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tactic here was to create a specifically-constructed request by a bad actor to circumvent email verification during the signup process,&#8221; Yamunan said. &#8220;The vector here is they would use one email address to try to sign in, and a completely different email address to verify a token. Once they were email verified, in some cases we have seen them access third party services using Google single sign-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yamunan said none of the potentially malicious workspace accounts were used to abuse Google services, but rather the attackers sought to impersonate the domain holder to other services online.</p>
<p>In the case of the reader who shared the breach notice from Google, the imposters used the authentication bypass to associate his domain with a Workspace account. And that domain was tied to his login at several third-party services online. Indeed, the alert this reader received from Google said the unauthorized Workspace account appears to have been used to sign in to his account at <strong>Dropbox</strong>.</p>
<p>Google said the now-fixed authentication bypass is unrelated to a recent issue involving cryptocurrency-based domain names that were <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/researchers-weak-security-defaults-enabled-squarespace-domains-hijacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apparently compromised in their transition to Squarespace</a>, which last year acquired more than 10 million domains that were registered via Google Domains.</p>
<p>On July 12, a number of domains tied to cryptocurrency businesses were hijacked from Squarespace users who hadn&#8217;t yet set up their Squarespace accounts. Squarespace has since published <a href="https://status.squarespace.com/incidents/cw2wf55bps15" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a statement</a> blaming the domain hijacks on “a weakness related to OAuth logins”, which Squarespace said it fixed within hours.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A Google Cloud Storage bucket leak has brought renewed attention to the risk of misconfigured cloud storage buckets, one of the most common cloud security issues and causes of data leaks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Alice’s Table, a former contestant on ABC’s Shark Tank, apparently inadvertently leaked more than <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/google-cloud-leak-alices-table/">37,000 files</a> from a misconfigured Google Cloud Storage bucket, including personally identifiable information (PII) of more than 83,000 customers, such as full names, email addresses, and home addresses.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some of the accounts were associated with organizations, ranging from Pfizer, PwC, and Charles Schwab to government accounts. The information could be used for malicious purposes, such as phishing and identity theft.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The leak underscores the importance of cloud storage bucket access control, and regularly auditing permissions and monitoring for data leaks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cloud storage bucket misconfigurations are surprisingly common – Cyble's <a href="https://search.odin.io/exposed-buckets?query=provider%253A%2522gcp%2522">Odin vulnerability search tool</a> is currently detecting more than 332,000 exposed AWS storage buckets and more than 168,000 Google Cloud Storage exposures.</p>

<p>We look at best practices and options for cloud storage access management – and ways to detect unintended or malicious access.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cloud Storage Bucket Access and Configuration Best Practices</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We don’t know exactly what went wrong in the Alice’s Table data exposure, but managing access to cloud storage buckets is a tricky practice that even the largest organizations can get wrong. We’ll look at access control options for cloud storage buckets in Google Cloud, how to make a bucket or objects readable to the public as securely as possible, and options for monitoring and detecting exposed buckets and data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Restrict Storage Bucket Access By Default</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The best way to secure a Google Cloud Storage bucket is to not make it public in the first place. Access to Cloud Storage buckets is restricted by default, but there may be legitimate reasons why users would want to make a bucket public.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google Cloud Storage offers two means for controlling access to storage buckets: Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Access Control Lists (ACL). IAM is the preferred method for securing buckets, but ACLs can be used to configure access for specific objects in a bucket.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google recommends <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access">uniform bucket-level access</a>, which disables ACLs and makes IAM the exclusive means for access control. The more fine-grained approach of using IAM and ACLs together poses a great risk of exposing data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-access-prevention">Public access prevention</a> is perhaps the strongest level of control, as it overrides IAM and ACL.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Making a Cloud Storage Bucket Readable to the Public</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To make all objects in a bucket readable to everyone on the public internet, you can &nbsp;grant the principal <em>allUsers</em> the Storage Object Viewer (<em>roles/storage.objectViewer</em>) role, which includes the permission required to list the objects in the bucket, but a safer approach is to grant the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles#legacy-roles">Storage Legacy Object Reader</a> role (<em>roles/storage.legacyObjectReader</em>) so users can access objects without listing them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another way to balance access and risk is to use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managed-folders">managed folders</a>, which allow fine-grained access to specific groups of objects with a bucket.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Detecting Exposed Cloud Storage Buckets</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There’s no easy way to detect exposed cloud storage buckets (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-logs">usage logs</a> are one possible option), so routine audits of bucket access permissions – and potentially removing permissions for <em>allUsers</em> and <em>allAuthenticatedUsers</em> – is a critically important practice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Data loss prevention (DLP) tools can help you identify where you have sensitive data stored that needs to be protected, and cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools can help you identify configuration issues.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Other important cloud storage security and compliance practices include object versioning, object encryption, and retention and lifecycle management.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble Odin can help organizations detect exposed cloud storage buckets, and dark web monitoring tools such as those from <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/dark-web-monitoring/">Cyble</a> can give organizations an early warning when leaks do occur so they can respond faster and take action to secure accounts and data.</p>
