<title>Foreign Threat Actor Conducting Large-Scale Spear-Phishing Campaign with RDP Attachments</title>
<link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/10/31/foreign-threat-actor-conducting-large-scale-spear-phishing-campaign-rdp-attachments</link>
<guid>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/10/31/foreign-threat-actor-conducting-large-scale-spear-phishing-campaign-rdp-attachments</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CISA has received multiple reports of a large-scale spear-phishing campaign targeting organizations in several sectors, including government and information technology (IT). The foreign threat actor, often posing as a trusted entity, is sending spear-phishing emails containing malicious remote desktop protocol (RDP) files to targeted organizations to connect to and access files stored on the target’s network. Once access has been gained, the threat actor may pursue additional activity, such as deploying malicious code to achieve persistent access to the target’s network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CISA, government, and industry partners are coordinating, responding, and assessing the impact of this campaign. CISA urges organizations to take proactive measures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Restrict Outbound RDP Connections:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is strongly advised that organizations forbid or significantly restrict outbound RDP connections to external or public networks. This measure is crucial for minimizing exposure to potential cyber threats.</li>
<li>Implement a Firewall along with secure policies and access control lists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Block RDP Files in Communication Platforms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Organizations should prohibit RDP files from being transmitted through email clients and webmail services. This step helps prevent the accidental execution of malicious RDP configurations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prevent Execution of RDP Files:&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Implement controls to block the execution of RDP files by users. This precaution is vital in reducing the risk of exploitation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multi-factor authentication must be enabled wherever feasible to provide an essential layer of security for remote access.</li>
<li>Avoid SMS MFA whenever possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adopt Phishing-Resistant Authentication Methods:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Organizations are encouraged to deploy phishing-resistant authentication solutions, such as FIDO tokens. It is important to avoid SMS-based MFA, as it can be vulnerable to SIM-jacking attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Implement Conditional Access Policies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Establish Conditional Access Authentication Strength to mandate the use of phishing-resistant authentication methods. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Organizations should implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to continuously monitor for and respond to suspicious activities within the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consider Additional Security Solutions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In conjunction with EDR, organizations should<strong> </strong>evaluate the deployment of antiphishing and antivirus solutions to bolster their defenses against emerging threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conduct User Education:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Robust user education can help mitigate the threat of social engineering and phishing emails. Companies should have a user education program that highlights how to identify and report suspicious emails.</li>
<li>Recognize and Report Phishing: <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/recognize-and-report-phishing">Avoid phishing with these simple tips</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hunt For Activity Using Referenced Indicators and TTPs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Utilize all indicators that are released in relevant articles and reporting to<strong> </strong>search for possible malicious activity within your organization’s network.</li>
<li>Search for unexpected and/or unauthorized outbound RDP connections within the last year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CISA urges users and administrators to remain vigilant against spear-phishing attempts, hunt for any malicious activity, report positive findings to CISA, and review the following articles for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/10/29/midnight-blizzard-conducts-large-scale-spear-phishing-campaign-using-rdp-files/">Midnight Blizzard conducts large-scale spear-phishing campaign using RDP files</a></li>
<li>AWS Security:&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/amazon-identified-internet-domains-abused-by-apt29/">Amazon identified internet domains abused by APT29</a></li>
<li>The Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium:&nbsp;<a href="https://atwork.safeonweb.be/recent-news-tips-and-warning/warning-government-themed-phishing-rdp-attachments">Warning: Government-themed Phishing with RDP Attachments</a></li>

As part of our balancing act, we’re also expanding on familiar threats while introducing some fresh behaviors and groups. This release also features optimized detection engineering offerings and enhanced usability across ATT&amp;CK tools, with the goal of a <em>balanced</em> resource for everyone.</p><p>For all the details on our updates/additions across Techniques, Software, Groups and Campaigns take a look at our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2024/">release notes</a>, our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/changes/">detailed changelog</a>, or our <a href="https://attacksite.mitre.org/changes/changelog.json">changelog.json</a>.</p><h3>Enterprise</h3><h4>Cloud Realigned</h4><p>We’ve been working to fine-tune the balance between abstraction and detail in the Cloud matrix to cover various cloud environments and threats, while staying specific enough to guide actionable defenses. v16 unveils our efforts to keep the matrix practical for defenders across diverse setups, clarify technique descriptions, and ensure that it’s intuitively navigable.</p><p>We’d like to introduce the recalibrated <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/"><strong>Cloud matrix</strong></a><strong>,</strong> now featuring four platforms (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/iaas/">Iaas</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/saas/">SaaS</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/identityprovider/">Identity Provider</a>, and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/officesuite/">Office Suite</a>) — key changes include:</p><ul><li>Broadened <strong>Identity</strong> concept to cover multiple products and services, reflecting how identity functions work similarly across cloud setups. <br /> – This includes incorporating <strong>Azure AD</strong> into <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/identityprovider/"><strong>Identity Provider</strong></a> for clearer cloud functionality distinctions.</li><li>Clarified the <strong>Google Workspace </strong>and <strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>365</strong> overlap with the new <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/officesuite/"><strong>Office Suite</strong></a> platform, as they behave nearly identically at the technique level.</li></ul><h4>Behavior Balancing Act</h4><p>We maintained our perfect balance formula (<em>Familiar + Novel = Reality</em>) with this release, expanding on existing techniques with behaviors you’ll recognize, but weren’t previously in the matrix — for example, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/004/">T1557.004: Adversary-in-the-Middle: Evil Twin</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/004/">T1213.004: Data from Information Repositories: Customer Relationship Management Software</a><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/005/">T1213:Data from Information Repositories: Messaging Applications</a>.</p><p>For the novelty factor, this release also features some intriguing new behaviors, like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496/004/">T1496.004:Resource Hijacking:Cloud Service Hijacking</a>, where adversaries can hijack compromised SaaS applications (like email and messaging services) to send spam, while also draining your resources and impacting service availability. We also added <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1666/">T1666: Modify Cloud Resource Hierarchy</a>, highlighting how IaaS hierarchies can be manipulated to evade defenses and exploit resources by creating covert subscriptions in Azure or detaching AWS accounts from their organizations.</p><p>Our<strong> Linux </strong>and<strong> macOS </strong>behavior repository also grew, with<strong> </strong>the highly demanded <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/017/">T1546.017: Event Triggered Execution: Udev Rules</a><strong>, </strong>where adversaries can persist on Linux by tweaking udev rules to run malicious code, exploiting its permissions and background capabilities. The new <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/005/">T1558.005: Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Ccache Files</a> sub reminds us how adversaries can swipe Kerberos tickets from credential cache files to access multiple services as the current user — and even indulge in a little privilege escalation or lateral movement.</p><p>For the full list of (sub) technique additions and expansions, check out the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/changes/">changelog</a>!</p><p><strong>What’s Next:</strong> We’re looking into a optimizing a couple of disparate areas — including restructuring <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/">Defense Evasion</a> for clarity and usability. One approach we’re assessing is to organize techniques based on the specific behaviors they represent: those that focus on evading detection and those aimed at circumventing specific mitigations. We’re also evaluating how to refactor metadata to only feature what’s useable and relevant. Have thoughts or would like to contribute insights to either discussion? Share them on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a> or <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">email</a>!</p><h3>Defensive Coverage</h3><h4>Detection Engineering</h4><p>Our Defensive goal for this year was to expand detections and mitigations, and help you get more actionable through detection engineering. With our optimization of our pseudocode format for analytics — reflecting real-world query language that is meant to serve as a template for your tailored queries — v16 is coming in hot with a whole host of new analytic blueprints.</p><p>In the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/">Execution</a>, we’ve added <strong>85 new analytics</strong>, to help you identify techniques that execute malicious code,<strong>120 new analytics</strong> under <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/">Credential Access</a> aimed at capturing the behaviors used to steal credentials, and <strong>26 new Cloud analytics</strong> designed to highlight techniques that exploit <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/officesuite/">Microsoft 365</a> &amp;<strong> </strong><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/identityprovider/">Azure AD</a>.</p><p>As a bonus, v16 also features a <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/blob/master/examples/analytic_extractor.py">STIX analytic extraction Python script</a> that lets you quickly pull and export analytics.</p><h4>Mitigations</h4><p>On the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise/">Mitigations</a> front, we added a new mitigation: <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1060/">Out of Band Communication</a>, focused on secure, alternative communication channels — like encrypted messaging or satellite lines — to keep critical comms safe and running during incidents and bypassing any compromised network systems. We also enhanced <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1015/">Active Directory Configuration</a> with a community contribution that adds clearer examples and detailed interpretations of group policy settings. As we continue to update Mitigations, we need your insights! When you share specific use cases, clearer examples, and detailed configurations, you’re making it easier for fellow defenders to understand and implement mitigations effectively.</p><p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>We have a lot on our docket and some areas we’re still considering, including implementing STIX IDs for data components to improve clarity and tracking, developing analytics for Initial Access and Exfiltration, and Discovery, and revamping our data sources for actionability. We’ll also looking into multi-event analytics that examine how different sources, like file modifications and process creation, interact within a short time frame instead of focusing on just one collection source. We would love your insights and collaboration on these initiatives — <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">email</a> or join <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036RA0B7EX">#defensive_attack</a> to get involved!</p><h3>Cyber Threat Intelligence</h3><p>Our CTI updates also embody the <em>perfect balance formula</em>: we’re working to close the representation gaps in the cybercrime space while continuing to update state-attributed groups.</p><p>Some of the cybercriminal additions in v16 include <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1032/">G1032</a> (Inc Ransom), a group notorious for its double-extortion tactics, as well as the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1040/">G1040</a> (Play) ransomware group, that utilizes advanced encryption and targeting of high-value victims. Both groups exploit known vulnerabilities to gain initial access and steal data before deploying their ransomware. Additionally, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1037/">G1037</a> operates as an initial access broker, using phishing techniques to infiltrate networks.</p><p>On the State front, we updated <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007/">G0007</a> and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/">G0034</a>, both linked to different units of Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), with common behaviors, such as using malicious Microsoft Office attachments in their spear-phishing emails.</p><p><strong>What’s Next:</strong> Moving forward, we intend to continue staying responsive to your contributions — highlighting groups, software, and campaigns that matter to practitioners, while also showcasing unique and exceptional tradecraft to highlight techniques. Got brilliant insights or behaviors to share?

We’ve been working hard towards these goals, but most importantly, we introduced our new TAXII server: the <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 Server</a> and open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">TAXII 2.1 code</a> to enable you to establish your own servers within your organization <em>and </em>contribute to enhancing it. As you’re exploring the new 2.1 server, remember that we’ll be retiring the TAXII 2.0 server on December 18. <strong>To continue receiving updated ATT&amp;CK data, you’ll need to migrate from cti-taxii.mitre.org to attack-taxii.mitre.org. </strong>Check out our <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-taxii-2-1-and-a-fond-farewell-to-taxii-2-0-d9fca6ce4c58">TAXII 2.1 blog post</a> for more details.</p><p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>We’re planning on rolling out ATT&amp;CK Data Model 1.0, which will introduce Platform objects and assign ATT&amp;CK IDs to data components for easier tracking. We’ll also be updating the defensive objects structure for intuitiveness and simplifying the Workbench process. On the website front, our goal is to move towards a modern framework and ensure consistency and clarity across ATT&amp;CK tools and documentation with STIX 2.1.</p><h3>You Bring the Insights, We’ll Bring the Updates</h3><p>We deeply value our community, and your in-the-wild examples and real-world implementations are what ensure that ATT&amp;CK remains relevant and actionable, so <em>if you see something, </em><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/engage-with-attack/contribute/"><em>contrib</em></a><em> something.</em></p><p>Looking ahead, we can’t wait to keep partnering with you on everything we have lined up — as well as all the things we haven’t planned yet but will absolutely end up on our agenda, thanks to your great contributions.</p><p>Connect with us on <a href="http://attack@mitre.org">Email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MITREattack">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mitre-att&amp;ck/">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a>.</p><p>©2024 The MITRE Corporation.

It is well known for the historic breaches of SolarWinds and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which are carried out by the Russian Federation's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). It has recently breached Microsoft's codebase and political targets in Europe, Africa, and beyond.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">"APT29 embodies the 'persistent' part of 'advanced persistent threat,'" notes Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable. "It has persistently targeted organizations in the United States and Europe for years, utilizing various techniques, including spear-phishing and exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain initial access and elevate privileges. Its modus operandi is the collection of foreign intelligence, as well as maintaining persistence in compromised organizations in order to conduct future operations.”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In the same vein, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recently found APT29 phishing Windows credentials from government, military, and commercial sector targets in Ukraine. After comparing notes with authorities in other nations, CERT-UA discovered that the campaign had expanded across "a wide geography."</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It is not surprising that APT29 would target sensitive credentials from geopolitically influential and diversified organisations, according to Narang. However, "the one thing that does kind of stray from the path would be its broad targeting, versus [its typical more] narrowly focused attacks.”&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>AWS and Microsoft</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Malicious domain names that were intended to seem to be linked to Amazon Web Services (AWS) were used in the August campaign. The emails received from these domains simulated to give recipients advice on how to set up zero trust architecture and combine AWS with Microsoft services. Despite the charade, AWS stated that neither Amazon nor its customers' AWS credentials were the target of the attackers.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The attachments to those emails revealed what APT29 was really looking for: configuration files for Remote Desktop, Microsoft's application for implementing the Remote Desktop Protocol. RDP is a common remote access technique used by regular consumers and hackers.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">"Normally, attackers will try to brute force their way into your system or exploit vulnerabilities, then have RDP configured. In this case, they're basically saying: 'We want to establish that connection [upfront],'" Narang added.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Launching one of these malicious attachments would have resulted in an immediate outbound RDP connection to an APT29 server. But that wasn't all: the files contained a number of other malicious parameters, such that when a connection was established, the perpetrator gained access to the target computer's storage, clipboard, audio devices, network resources, printers, communication (COM) ports, and more, as well as the ability to execute custom malicious scripts.</span></div></span>

As per a report in a local media outlet, the investigation was launched following claims made by a well-known hacker identified as “IntelBroker.”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“Cisco is aware of reports that an actor is alleging to have gained access to certain Cisco-related files,” a Cisco spokesperson stated. “We have launched an investigation to assess this claim, and our investigation is ongoing.”&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The allegations surfaced after IntelBroker claimed, along with two others designated as "EnergyWeaponUser" and "zjj," that they infiltrated Cisco's servers on June 10, 2024, and obtained a large amount of developer-related data.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">IntelBroker's post on a hacking forum showed that the data would include "GitHub projects, GitLab projects, SonarQube projects, source code, hard-coded credentials, certificates, customer SRCs, Cisco confidential documents, Jira tickets, API tokens, AWS private buckets, Cisco technology SRCs, Docker builds, Azure storage buckets, private and public keys, SSL certificates, Cisco premium products, and more." The hacker uploaded samples of a database, client information, multiple files, and screenshots of customer management interfaces.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to a recent update from IntelBroker, the breach also involves the theft of sensitive data from other major global companies such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Microsoft. The stolen data is now allegedly being offered for sale on the cybercrime platform Breach Forums, with IntelBroker specifying that the transaction would take place in exchange for Monero (XMR), a cryptocurrency known for its anonymity properties.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The hacker expressed a willingness to use an intermediary to facilitate the sale, assuring anonymity for both the buyer and seller. This technique is often used by hackers to evade detection by authorities.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">IntelBroker, which is known for high-profile data thefts, has already claimed responsibility for compromising other prominent firms. In June 2024, IntelBroker reported that they had infiltrated Apple, taking source code for internal tools, as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), stealing employee and product information. In May 2024, IntelBroker claimed to have hacked Europol, which the organisation later confirmed.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">IntelBroker did not provide any specific details on the techniques employed to acquire the data. The stolen data originated from a third-party managed services provider that specialises in software development and DevOps, according to sources knowledgeable with the breaches who spoke with BleepingComputer. It's still unclear if the earlier June incidents and the recent Cisco hack are linked.</span></div></span>

<title>Risk, reward and reality: Has enterprise perception of the public cloud changed?</title>
<link>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/risk-reward-reality-enterprise-perception-public-cloud/</link>
<guid>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/risk-reward-reality-enterprise-perception-public-cloud/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Public clouds now form the bulk of enterprise IT environments. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/817296/worldwide-enterprise-cloud-strategy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Statista data</a>, 73% of enterprises use a hybrid cloud model, 14% use multiple public clouds and 10% use a single public cloud solution. Multiple and single private clouds make up the remaining 3%.</p>
<p>With enterprises historically reticent to adopt public clouds, adoption data seems to indicate a shift in perception. Perhaps enterprise efforts have finally moved away from reducing risk to prioritizing the potential rewards of public cloud resources.</p>
<p>Reality, however, isn&rsquo;t so cut-and-dry. Here&rsquo;s a look at the current state of public perception, where enterprises still encounter cloud issues and how familiar concerns have a new focus: AI.</p>
<h2>Public perception on cloud computing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cloud computing</a> has always had a perception problem. From the perspective of enterprise C-suites and IT teams, public clouds meant bigger <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">attack surfaces</a> combined with lower visibility, giving attackers the upper hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from the perspective of consumers &mdash; which all C-suite and IT team members become on their days off &mdash; the cloud came with massive potential. From file and photo storage to streaming video services and worldwide e-commerce, the public cloud quickly became commonplace in public life.</p>
<p>So why the disconnect? In large part, enterprises were concerned about the man behind the curtain. While many providers were long on promises, they were short on details. The result was a &ldquo;shared responsibility&rdquo; model that saw both customer and provider playing a role in data defense, but neither one was entirely clear on what that role entailed. This was exemplified by a Capital One <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data breach</a> in 2019, which saw both the bank and its cloud partner, AWS, <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/shared-responsibility-models-cloud-security-azure-aws-google/596579/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">under scrutiny for their security</a>.</p>
<p>To help address these concerns, cloud providers doubled down on security. In 2021, Amazon, Google, IBM and Apple <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/tech-giants-commit-30b-to-cybersecurity-after-white-house-meeting/2021/08/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pledged $30 billion</a> to help address growing security concerns. It worked: In 2024, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/12/latest-trends-and-predictions-for-the-future-of-cloud-hosting/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">94% of businesses</a> reported improvement in security after moving to the cloud. Or consider the results of Flexera&rsquo;s State of the Cloud Report: In <a href="https://www.flexera.com/about-us/press-center/flexera-releases-2020-state-of-the-cloud-report" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2020</a>, security was the top concern among executives. In 2024, security has fallen to second place.</p>
<p>The data tells the tale: Enterprise public cloud perception is changing.</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-53217">Strengthen your cloud defenses</a>
<h2>Ongoing cloud challenges</h2>
<p>While cloud providers have made significant strides in addressing security concerns, other issues remain.</p>
<p>For example, the top challenge in Flexera&rsquo;s 2024 State of the Cloud Report is managing cloud spend, cited by 82% of enterprises, while lack of resources and expertise comes in third with 79%.</p>
<p>When it comes to cloud spending, there&rsquo;s no easy answer. In fact, ease is sometimes the issue. As providers streamline the process of purchasing, deploying and integrating cloud-based applications and services, it&rsquo;s easy for enterprises to lose track of exactly what they have, exactly where it is and exactly how much it costs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that spending shows up twice on the Flexera report: Once in the top spot for cloud spend at large and again in fourth place as companies struggle to manage software licenses across multiple clouds and applications.</p>
<p>Lack of resources and expertise, meanwhile, remains a persistent challenge for enterprises. According to research from <a href="https://www.softwareone.com/en/blog/articles/2023/11/13/cloud-skills-gap-in-2023" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Software One</a>, 95% of businesses now face a cloud and IT skills gap. While upskilling current staff can help reduce the impact of this gap, the expansion of public cloud environments creates the longer term problem of doing more work with fewer people. While it&rsquo;s possible to task IT teams with handling the public cloud in addition to other line-of-business objectives, the results can lead back to the original concern with cloud deployments: Reduced security.</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s old is new again</h2>
<p>Even as enterprises come to terms with the necessity and ubiquity of the cloud, a new challenge has emerged: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the public cloud, artificial intelligence has the potential to change the way enterprises do business. But it also opens new avenues for security compromise, leading many companies to remain cautious of AI adoption.</p>
<p>In some cases, this means limiting the scope of AI in enterprise environments. For example, organizations might leverage AI in process automation but shy away from using generative tools for content creation or sales efforts. They might deploy <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI solutions</a> to analyze disparate data but only trust humans to turn output into action.</p>
<p>The result is a perceptive landscape that is both similar and distinct from its cloud predecessor. Consider recent data from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-30-gartner-survey-shows-rising-concern-of-ai-enhanced-malicious-attacks-as" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, which found that the top concern cities by companies in Q2 2024 were AI-enhanced malicious attacks. This aligns with historic worries about the public cloud as a path to compromise &mdash; if attackers could access shared resources, they could potentially cause inter-departmental chaos.</p>
<p>AI, however, comes with a unique concern: Evolution. While cloud-based threats made use of expanded attack surfaces, they remained fundamentally the same as their previous-generation counterparts: If tools didn&rsquo;t work, it was back to the drawing board for malicious actors.</p>
<p>In the case of AI, meanwhile, code isn&rsquo;t static. Instead, both failure and success inform the next iteration of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ransomware</a> tools or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/malware" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Malware</a>-as-a-Service offerings. This ongoing improvement is similarly present on the protective side of AI adoption, but in both cases &mdash; attack and defense &mdash; the approach to AI is naturally different than that of the cloud.</p>
<h2>The reality of cloud security</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-security" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="resolved">Cloud security</span></a> has evolved from nebulous assurance to core component of public offerings. The results speak for themselves: More enterprises are adopting the public cloud, more enterprises are reporting improved security and fewer companies are citing security as their to-cloud challenge.</p>
<p>AI, meanwhile, has stepped up to take on the role of top security concern. In much the same way as cloud computing, some concerns around <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ai-cybersecurity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI security</a> are overblown &mdash; as the market diversifies and standardization becomes critical, companies can expect common security issues to be effectively resolved.</p>
<p>Where AI and cloud go their separate ways, however, is in the evolution of future threats. While cloud frameworks have changed to meet new corporate needs, they remain fundamentally bound by basic infrastructure. AI has no such limits, making it harder to predict the course of its development over time.</p>
<p>The reality? Cloud perception has shifted to reward. The rise of AI, however, now underpins a renewed focus on enterprise <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a> risk.</p>

<title>A Single Cloud Compromise Can Feed an Army of AI Sex Bots</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Organizations that get relieved of credentials to their cloud environments can quickly find themselves part of a disturbing new trend: Cybercriminals using stolen cloud credentials to operate and resell sexualized AI-powered chat services. Researchers say these illicit chat bots, which use custom jailbreaks to bypass content filtering, often veer into darker role-playing scenarios, including child sexual exploitation and rape.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69091" style="width: 747px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69091" height="488" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bedrock.png" width="737" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69091">Image: Shutterstock.</p></div>
<p>Researchers at security firm <strong>Permiso Security</strong> say attacks against generative artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure like <strong>Bedrock</strong> from Amazon Web Services (AWS) have increased markedly over the last six months, particularly when someone in the organization accidentally exposes their cloud credentials or key online, such as in a code repository like <strong>GitHub</strong>.</p>
<p>Investigating the abuse of AWS accounts for several organizations, Permiso found attackers had seized on stolen AWS credentials to interact with the <strong>large language models</strong> (LLMs) available on Bedrock. But they also soon discovered none of these AWS users had enabled logging (it is off by default), and thus they lacked any visibility into what attackers were doing with that access.</p>
<p>So Permiso researchers decided to leak their own test AWS key on GitHub, while turning on logging so that they could see exactly what an attacker might ask for, and what the responses might be.</p>
<p>Within minutes, their bait key was scooped up and used to power a service that offers AI-powered sex chats online.</p>
<p>&#8220;After reviewing the prompts and responses it became clear that the attacker was hosting an AI roleplaying service that leverages common jailbreak techniques to get the models to accept and respond with content that would normally be blocked,&#8221; Permiso researchers wrote in <a href="https://permiso.io/blog/exploiting-hosted-models" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report released today</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all of the roleplaying was of a sexual nature, with some of the content straying into darker topics such as child sexual abuse,&#8221; they continued. &#8220;Over the course of two days we saw over 75,000 successful model invocations, almost all of a sexual nature.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ian Ahl</strong>, senior vice president of threat research at Permiso, said attackers in possession of a working cloud account traditionally have used that access for run-of-the-mill financial cybercrime, such as cryptocurrency mining or spam. But over the past six months, Ahl said, Bedrock has emerged as one of the top targeted cloud services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad guy hosts a chat service, and subscribers pay them money,&#8221; Ahl said of the business model for commandeering Bedrock access to power sex chat bots. &#8220;They don&#8217;t want to pay for all the prompting that their subscribers are doing, so instead they hijack someone else&#8217;s infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahl said much of the AI-powered chat conversations initiated by the users of their honeypot AWS key were harmless roleplaying of sexual behavior.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a percentage of it is also geared toward very illegal stuff, like child sexual assault fantasies and rapes being played out,&#8221; Ahl said. &#8220;And these are typically things the large language models won&#8217;t be able to talk about.&#8221;</p>
<p>AWS&#8217;s Bedrock uses large language models from <strong>Anthropic</strong>, which incorporates a number of technical restrictions aimed at placing certain ethical guardrails on the use of their LLMs. But attackers can evade or &#8220;jailbreak&#8221; their way out of these restricted settings, usually by asking the AI to imagine itself in an elaborate hypothetical situation under which its normal restrictions might be relaxed or discarded altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;A typical jailbreak will pose a very specific scenario, like you&#8217;re a writer who&#8217;s doing research for a book, and everyone involved is a consenting adult, even though they often end up chatting about nonconsensual things,&#8221; Ahl said.</p>
<p>In June 2024, security experts at <strong>Sysdig</strong> <a href="https://sysdig.com/blog/llmjacking-stolen-cloud-credentials-used-in-new-ai-attack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documented a new attack</a> that leveraged stolen cloud credentials to target ten cloud-hosted LLMs. The attackers Sysdig wrote about gathered cloud credentials through a known security vulnerability, but the researchers also found the attackers sold LLM access to other cybercriminals while sticking the cloud account owner with an astronomical bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once initial access was obtained, they exfiltrated cloud credentials and gained access to the cloud environment, where they attempted to access local LLM models hosted by cloud providers: in this instance, a local Claude (v2/v3) LLM model from Anthropic was targeted,&#8221; Sysdig researchers wrote. &#8220;If undiscovered, this type of attack could result in over $46,000 of LLM consumption costs per day for the victim.&#8221;<span id="more-68998"></span></p>
<p>Ahl said it&#8217;s not certain who is responsible for operating and selling these sex chat services, but Permiso suspects the activity may be tied to a platform cheekily named &#8220;<strong>chub[.]ai</strong>,&#8221; which offers a broad selection of pre-made AI characters with whom users can strike up a conversation. Permiso said almost every character name from the prompts they captured in their honeypot could be found at Chub.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69090" style="width: 758px;"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/chubai.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-69090 " height="265" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/chubai.png" width="748" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69090">Some of the AI chat bot characters offered by Chub. Some of these characters include the tags &#8220;rape&#8221; and &#8220;incest.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Chub offers free registration, via its website or a mobile app. But after a few minutes of chatting with their newfound AI friends, users are asked to purchase a subscription. The site&#8217;s homepage features a banner at the top that strongly suggests the service is reselling access to existing cloud accounts. It reads: &#8220;Banned from OpenAI? Get unmetered access to uncensored alternatives for as little as $5 a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until late last week Chub offered a wide selection of characters in a category called &#8220;<strong>NSFL</strong>&#8221; or Not Safe for Life, a term meant to describe content that is disturbing or nauseating to the point of being emotionally scarring.</p>
<p><em>Fortune</em> profiled Chub AI in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-openai-spawned-wave-ai-140000660.html?guccounter=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a January 2024 story</a> that described the service as a virtual brothel advertised by illustrated girls in spaghetti strap dresses who promise a chat-based &#8220;world without feminism,&#8221; where &#8220;girls offer sexual services.&#8221; From that piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chub AI offers more than 500 such scenarios, and a growing number of other sites are enabling similar AI-powered child pornographic role-play. They are part of a broader uncensored AI economy that, according to Fortune’s interviews with 18 AI developers and founders, was spurred first by OpenAI and then accelerated by Meta’s release of its open-source Llama tool.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortune says Chub is run by someone using the handle &#8220;<strong>Lore</strong>,&#8221; who said they launched the service to help others evade content restrictions on AI platforms. Chub charges fees starting at $5 a month to use the new chatbots, and the founder told Fortune the site had generated more than $1 million in annualized revenue.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment about Permiso&#8217;s research from AWS, which initially seemed to downplay the seriousness of the researchers&#8217; findings. The company noted that AWS employs automated systems that will alert customers if their credentials or keys are found exposed online.</p>
<p>AWS explained that when a key or credential pair is flagged as exposed, it is then restricted to limit the amount of abuse that attackers can potentially commit with that access. For example, flagged credentials can&#8217;t be used to create or modify authorized accounts, or spin up new cloud resources.</p>
<p>Ahl said Permiso did indeed receive multiple alerts from AWS about their exposed key, including one that warned their account may have been used by an unauthorized party. But they said the restrictions AWS placed on the exposed key did nothing to stop the attackers from using it to abuse Bedrock services.</p>
<p>Sometime in the past few days, however, AWS responded by including Bedrock in the list of services that will be quarantined in the event an AWS key or credential pair is found compromised or exposed online. AWS confirmed that Bedrock was a new addition to its quarantine procedures.</p>
<p>Additionally, not long after KrebsOnSecurity began reporting this story, Chub&#8217;s website removed its NSFL section. It also appears to have removed cached copies of the site from the Wayback Machine at archive.org. Still, Permiso found that Chub&#8217;s user stats page shows the site has more than 3,000 AI conversation bots with the NSFL tag, and that 2,113 accounts were following the NSFL tag.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69088" style="width: 758px;"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/chub-nsfl.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-69088" height="250" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/chub-nsfl.png" width="748" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69088">The user stats page at Chub shows more than 2,113 people have subscribed to its AI conversation bots with the &#8220;Not Safe for Life&#8221; designation.</p></div>
<p>Permiso said their entire two-day experiment generated a $3,500 bill from AWS. Some of that cost was tied to the 75,000 LLM invocations caused by the sex chat service that hijacked their key. But they said the remaining cost was a result of turning on LLM prompt logging, which is not on by default and can get expensive very quickly.</p>
<p>Which may explain why none of Permiso&#8217;s clients had that type of logging enabled. Paradoxically, Permiso found that while enabling these logs is the only way to know for sure how crooks might be using a stolen key, the cybercriminals who are reselling stolen or exposed AWS credentials for sex chats have started including programmatic checks in their code to ensure they aren&#8217;t using AWS keys that have prompt logging enabled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enabling logging is actually a deterrent to these attackers because they are immediately checking to see if you have logging on,&#8221; Ahl said. &#8220;At least some of these guys will totally ignore those accounts, because they don&#8217;t want anyone to see what they&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, AWS said its services are operating securely, as designed, and that no customer action is needed. Here is their statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;AWS services are operating securely, as designed, and no customer action is needed. The researchers devised a testing scenario that deliberately disregarded security best practices to test what may happen in a very specific scenario. No customers were put at risk. To carry out this research, security researchers ignored fundamental security best practices and publicly shared an access key on the internet to observe what would happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;AWS, nonetheless, quickly and automatically identified the exposure and notified the researchers, who opted not to take action. We then identified suspected compromised activity and took additional action to further restrict the account, which stopped this abuse. We recommend customers follow security best practices, such as protecting their access keys and avoiding the use of long-term keys to the extent possible. We thank Permiso Security for engaging AWS Security.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>AWS said customers can configure <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-invocation-logging.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">model invocation logging</a> to collect Bedrock invocation logs, model input data, and model output data for all invocations in the AWS account used in Amazon Bedrock. Customers can also use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CloudTrail to monitor Amazon Bedrock API calls</a>.</p>
<p>The company said AWS customers also can use services such as GuardDuty to detect potential security concerns and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Billing Alarms</a> to provide notifications of abnormal billing activity. Finally, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AWS Cost Explorer</a> is intended to give customers a way to visualize and manage Bedrock costs and usage over time.</p>
<p>Anthropic told KrebsOnSecurity it is always working on novel techniques to make its models more resistant to the kind of jailbreaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We remain committed to implementing strict policies and advanced techniques to protect users, as well as publishing our own research so that other AI developers can learn from it,&#8221; Anthropic said in an emailed statement. &#8220;We appreciate the research community&#8217;s efforts in highlighting potential vulnerabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthropic said it uses feedback from child safety experts at <a href="https://www.thorn.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thorn</a> around signals often seen in child grooming to update its classifiers, enhance its usage policies, fine tune its models, and incorporate those signals into testing of future models.</p>

They can support multilingual text production and vision apps like image recognition.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“This is our first open source, multimodal model, and it’s going to enable a lot of interesting applications that require visual understanding,” stated Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Llama 3.2 is based on the huge open source model Llama 3.1, which was released in late July. The previous Llama model was the largest open-source AI model in history, with 405 billion parameters (parameters are the adjustable variables within an AI model that help it learn patterns from data). The size shows the AI's ability to interpret and generate human-like text.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The new Llama models presented at Meta Connect 2024 are significantly reduced in size.

The 3B model exceeds Google's Gemma 2 2.6B and Microsoft's Phi 3.5-mini in tasks such as instruction following and content summarisation.

The 90B version, the largest of the models, surpasses both Claude 3-Haiku and GPT-4o-mini on a variety of benchmarks, including the widely used MMLU test, an industry-leading AI model evaluation tool.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>How to access Llama 3.2 models&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The new Llama 3.2 models are open source, so anyone can download and use them to power AI applications. The models can be downloaded straight from llama.com or Hugging Face, a popular open source repository platform. Llama 3.2 models are also available through a number of cloud providers, including Google Cloud, AWS, Nvidia, Microsoft Azure, and Grow, among others.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to figures published in early September, demand for Meta's Llama models from cloud customers increased tenfold between January and July, and is expected to rise much more in the wake of the new 3.2 line of models. Meta partner Together AI is providing free access to the vision version of Llama 3.2 11B on its platform till the end of the year.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Vipul Ved Prakash, founder and CEO of Together AI, stated that the new multimodal models will drive the adoption of open-source AI among developers and organisations.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“We’re thrilled to partner with Meta to offer developers free access to the Llama 3.2 vision model and to be one of the first API providers for Llama Stack,” Prakash noted. “With Together AI's support for Llama models and Llama Stack, developers and enterprises can experiment, build, and scale multimodal applications with the best performance, accuracy, and cost.”</span></div></span>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) has uncovered a previously undetected Android spyware campaign targeting individuals in South Korea, which has been active since June 2024. The spyware leverages an Amazon AWS S3 bucket as its Command and Control (C&amp;C) server and is designed to exfiltrate sensitive data from compromised devices, including contacts, SMS messages, images, and videos.</p>
<p>The spyware samples observed disguise themselves as live video apps, adult apps, refund apps, and interior design applications. Below are the icons used by the malware.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since its emergence, this malware has remained undetected by all security solutions, allowing it to operate stealthily. CRIL has identified four unique samples linked to this spyware, all exhibiting zero detection rates across major antivirus engines.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All identified spyware samples were observed communicating with the same Command and Control (C&amp;C) server hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket: <strong>hxxps://phone-books[.]s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/</strong>. Our analysis revealed that the stolen data, including contacts, SMS messages, images, and videos, was openly stored in the S3 bucket (C&amp;C server), further confirming that the malware specifically targeted individuals in South Korea.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":63082,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63082" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Figure-4-–-Exposed-data-on-S3-bucket.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Figure 4 – Exposed data on S3 bucket</em></figcaption></figure>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attackers' poor operational security resulted in the unintentional exposure of sensitive data. We reported the misuse of the AmazonAWS S3 bucket to Amazon Trust and Safety, which disabled access to the URL and made the data no longer accessible. Furthermore, our investigation found no other C&amp;C servers utilizing S3 buckets or exposing stolen data linked to this campaign.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After installation, all spyware samples display a single screen with a message in Korean tailored to the app's theme.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":63088,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63088" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Figure-8-–-Screen-loaded-upon-installation-1024x397.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Figure 8 – Screen loaded upon installation</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The source code of this spyware is relatively simple. It utilizes a minimal set of permissions, including “READ_SMS,” “READ_CONTACTS,” and “READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,” to carry out its malicious operations. The manifest file specifies only the main activity, which triggers the malicious functionality upon execution.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":63089,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63089" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Figure-9-–-Manifest-file-1024x492.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Figure 9 – Manifest file</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Upon installation, the spyware requests the necessary permissions; once granted, it executes its malicious functions. These functions, responsible for collecting data from the infected device, are executed within the API method “onRequestPermissionsResult”, as illustrated in the image below.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":63090,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-63090" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Figure-10-–-Malware-executing-malicious-functions-in-onRequestPermissionResult-method-1024x516.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Figure 10 – Malware executing malicious functions in onRequestPermissionResult method</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To exfiltrate images and videos, the malware queries the device's content provider and uploads each file to the C&amp;C server via the endpoint “/media/+filename”. This behavior is evident in the exposed data, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":63092,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The malware gathers contacts and SMS messages from the infected device and stores them in two separate files: phone.json for contacts and sms.json for SMS data. These files are then transmitted to the C&amp;C server, as demonstrated in the figure below.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This campaign highlights the growing sophistication of Android spyware targeting individuals in South Korea. By utilizing an Amazon AWS S3 bucket for Command and Control infrastructure, the <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/" title="threat actors">threat actors</a> were able to maintain stealth and evade detection for an extended period. This spyware strain utilizes a minimalist approach—leveraging only a few key permissions to exfiltrate sensitive data such as contacts, SMS messages, images, and videos—and demonstrates how even simple malware can be extremely effective.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is concerning that attackers are increasingly turning to trusted cloud services like AWS as part of their malicious infrastructure. This tactic allows them to bypass traditional security measures and stay under the radar.</p>

Veeam first revealed the flaw, dubbed CVE-2024-40711, on Thursday, when it issued fixes to address 18 vulnerabilities across its product range, including five major issues, which are so named because they may be remotely abused to execute arbitrary code.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The upgrade for the widely used Veeam Backup &amp; Replication software patches security flaws detected in version 12.1.2.172 and all previous version 12 versions. The software is employed for backup and recovery in cloud, virtual, and physical IT settings and is directly compatible with operating systems and environments such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle, SAP Hana, and Broadcom's VMware.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Veeam Backup &amp; Replication versions that are no longer supported, such as version 11, for which support ended in February, come with a warning from the company stating that they "are not tested, but are likely affected and should be considered vulnerable."&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Threat actors can exploit CVE-2024-40711 to remotely execute code on a Veeam Backup &amp; Replication server without having to first authenticate to the server.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYahwi7Z2_VX3-2ur8VuJsvO9Sw-YMzyHqe5bkxCXkFemYM1oxLsDkQ_CnQgu61Zk69hFTflTY3KvZ71jPjB8xZwN8f_y57y2PmNLtwn04B2tDrpEfcXCeL_QHuiJwupwZHzj-S-SS4-qn1xRHofw3VvTmjr59x-4AbGzEAdYWELfLg_uWsf6SRwepvVJ8/s4000/cloud-computing-2001090.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYahwi7Z2_VX3-2ur8VuJsvO9Sw-YMzyHqe5bkxCXkFemYM1oxLsDkQ_CnQgu61Zk69hFTflTY3KvZ71jPjB8xZwN8f_y57y2PmNLtwn04B2tDrpEfcXCeL_QHuiJwupwZHzj-S-SS4-qn1xRHofw3VvTmjr59x-4AbGzEAdYWELfLg_uWsf6SRwepvVJ8/w640-h360/cloud-computing-2001090.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">It was observed during an incident response engagement handled by Unit 42, that the threat actor group Bling Libra (which was responsible for distributing ShinyHunters ransomware) had shifted from extortion to extortion of victims rather than its traditional tactic of selling/publishing stolen data in an attempt to increase their profits.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During this engagement, it was also demonstrated how the group was able to acquire legitimate credentials, which were accessed from public repositories, to gain initial access to an organization's Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment through its public username and password.

The compromised credentials had limited impact due to the limited permissions associated with them, but Bling Libra managed to infiltrate the organization's AWS environment and conduct reconnaissance operations on it during this time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The threat actor group used various tools for gaining information and accessing S3 bucket configurations, interacting with S3 objects, as well as deleting files from the service using tools such as the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Browser and WinSCP.

As a result of previous jobs with high-profile data breaches, including the Microsoft GitHub and Tokopedia incidents in 2020, Bling Libra has developed a special part of their business model that enables them to monetize stolen data through underground marketplaces.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There has, however, been a significant change in the methods that Unit 42 implements, which have been reported in a recent report. As of 2024, Bling Libra has revitalized its business model from data theft to extortion, primarily targeting vulnerabilities within cloud-based environments to heighten its revenue.

As Unit 42 explained in its latest report, Bling Libra obtained AWS credentials from a sensitive file that was exposed online to perform the latest attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">AWS account credentials were obtained from an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, which would have provided the attackers with access to the victim's account on Amazon Web Services (AWS). While the permissions for accessing Amazon S3 resources were restricted, Bling Libra exploited them to gain a foothold in the cloud environment even though they were limited.

Even though Bling Libra uses the same method of accessing victims for the first few minutes, it has instead instigated the double-extortion tactics normally associated with ransomware gangs - they initially steal data from victims and threaten to publish it online if they do not pay the ransom.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to the researchers, Bling Libra used credentials from a sensitive file exposed by the attacker on the Internet as a way of stealing the credentials, even though this file contained a variety of credentials. Aside from these exposed AWS access keys, the group also alleged that it "targeted a few other one-time credentials that were exposed by this individual as well as a few other exposed AWS access keys belonging to this individual.".&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Using these credentials, it is possible for the threat actors to gain access to the AWS account where the IAM user resides and to use the AWS API call to interact with the S3 bucket under the context of the AmazonS3FullAccess policy, which allows all permissions to be granted to users.

The attackers in this case sat on the network and lurked for about a month before launching an attack that led to the exfiltration of information, its deletion from the environment, and the recovery of an extortion note demanding ransom payment.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Their ransom note gave them a week to make their payment. It has been reported that Bling Libra also created new S3 buckets in the aftermath of their attack, presumably to mock the organization about the attack, as well.

Ticketmaster's attack in June was notable because of how much data Bling Libra was able to obtain during this attack. At the time, the organization claimed that a total of more than half a million records were stolen, some of which contained Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, emails, addresses, and partial credit card information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In May, the same group also claimed responsibility for several other attacks on other companies, including Ticketek Entertainment Group (TEG), in Australia, that occurred around the same period as Ticketmaster. Like Ticketmaster, TEG was attacked at the beginning of May. This group has been associated with several significant data breaches that have affected millions of records of data, and the implications have been severe.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the final phase of the attack, Bling Libra created new S3 buckets with mocking names to signify their control over the environment, illustrating their ability to manipulate the system.

The threat group known as Bling Libra has adopted a new tactic, pivoting to extortion as a primary method for monetizing their cyber breaches.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Following their recent cloud-based attacks, the group sent out extortion emails demanding payment in exchange for the return of stolen data and the cessation of further malicious activities. This shift in strategy underscores their focus on using extortion as a central means to profit from their operations.

A recent report by Unit 42 offers a comprehensive analysis of Bling Libra's operational tools, particularly emphasizing their use of S3 Browser and WinSCP.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">These tools enable the threat actors to interact seamlessly with Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments. The report provides in-depth insights that assist incident responders in distinguishing between legitimate tool usage and activities indicative of a security breach.

To counteract such threats, Unit 42 strongly advises organizations to adhere to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users have only the minimal level of access necessary to perform their functions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, they recommend implementing robust security measures, including the use of AWS IAM Access Analyzer and AWS Service Control Policies. These tools are essential for mitigating the risks associated with similar attacks on cloud infrastructure.

As businesses increasingly depend on cloud technologies, maintaining a proactive and vigilant cybersecurity posture is critical. Organizations must be diligent in their efforts to protect their cloud environments from sophisticated threat actors like Bling Libra.</div>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a>Operational Dynamics of RansomHub</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://cyble.com/products/cyble-vision/">Cyble’s vision report</a>, RansomHub appears to be an evolution of the Knight ransomware group, with ties to <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/alphv-ransomware-expands-its-arsenal-of-extortion-techniques/">ALPHV</a> affiliates and a distinctive Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. This model includes a prepayment scheme, adding a layer of complexity to the attack process.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ransomware exploits known vulnerabilities like Zerologon for initial access, further underscoring its sophisticated nature. The group’s operations reveal a preference for utilizing advanced techniques, including zero-day vulnerabilities and sophisticated data exfiltration methods.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware" title="#StopRansomware"><em>stopransomware.gov</em></a><em> to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources.</em></p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations)&nbsp;are releasing this joint advisory to disseminate known RansomHub ransomware IOCs and TTPs. These have been identified through FBI threat response activities and third-party reporting as recently as August 2024. RansomHub is a ransomware-as-a-service variant—formerly known as Cyclops and Knight—that has established itself as an efficient and successful service model (recently attracting high-profile affiliates from other prominent variants such as LockBit and ALPHV).</p>
<p>Since its inception in February 2024, RansomHub has encrypted and exfiltrated data from at least 210 victims representing the water and wastewater, information technology, government services and facilities, healthcare and public health, emergency services, food and agriculture, financial services, commercial facilities, critical manufacturing, transportation, and communications critical infrastructure sectors.</p>
<p>The affiliates leverage a double-extortion model by encrypting systems and exfiltrating&nbsp;data to extort victims. It should be noted that data exfiltration methods are dependent on the affiliate conducting the network compromise. The ransom note dropped during encryption does not generally include an initial ransom demand or payment instructions. Instead, the note provides victims with a client ID and instructs them to contact the ransomware group via a unique <code>.onion</code> URL (reachable through the Tor browser). The ransom note typically gives victims between three and 90 days to pay the ransom (depending on the affiliate) before the ransomware group publishes their data on the RansomHub Tor data leak site.</p>
<p>The authoring organizations encourage network defenders to implement the recommendations in the&nbsp;<strong>Mitigations</strong> section of this cybersecurity advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents.</p>

<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This advisory uses the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/matrices/enterprise/" title="Enterprise Matrix">MITRE ATT&amp;CK<sup>®</sup> Matrix for Enterprise</a> framework, version 15. See the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.</p>
<h3>Initial Access</h3>
<p>RansomHub affiliates typically compromise internet facing systems and user endpoints by using methods such as phishing emails [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1566/" title="Phishing">T1566</a>], exploitation of known vulnerabilities [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1190/" title="Exploit Public-Facing Application">T1190</a>], and password spraying [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1110/003/" title="Brute Force: Password Spraying">T1110.003</a>]. Password spraying targets accounts compromised through data breaches. Proof-of-concept exploits are obtained from sources such as ExploitDB and GitHub [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1588/005/" title="Obtain Capabilities: Exploits">T1588.005</a>]. Exploits based on the following CVEs have been observed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3519" title="CVE-2023-3519">CVE-2023-3519</a> (<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cwe-details/94/Improper-Control-of-Generation-of-Code-Code-Injection-.html" title="CWE-94 : Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')">CWE-94</a>)
<ul>
<li>Citrix ADC (NetScaler) Remote Code Execution. A vulnerability exists within Citrix ADC that allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a stack buffer overflow of the NSPPE (NetScaler Packet Processing Engine) process by making a specially crafted HTTP GET request.

<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>RansomHub affiliates conduct network scanning with tools such as AngryIPScanner, Nmap, and PowerShell-based living off the land methods with PowerShell to conduct network scanning [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1018/" title="Remote System Discovery">T1018</a>][<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1046/" title="Network Service Discovery">T1046</a>][<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1059/001/" title="Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell">T1059.001</a>].</p>
<h3>Defense Evasion</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity researchers have observed affiliates renaming the ransomware executable with innocuous file names, such as <code>Windows.exe</code>, left on the user’s desktop (<code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop</code>) or downloads (<code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads</code>) [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1036/" title="Masquerading">T1036</a>]. The affiliates have also cleared Windows and Linux system logs to inhibit any potential incident response [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1070/" title="Indicator Removal">T1070</a>]. Affiliates used Windows Management Instrumentation [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1047/" title="Windows Management Instrumentation">T1047</a>] to disable antivirus products. In some instances, RansomHub-specific tools were deployed to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) tooling [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1562/001/" title="Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools">T1562.001</a>].</p>
<h3>Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement</h3>
<p>Following initial access, RansomHub affiliates created user accounts for persistence [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1136/" title="Create Account">T1136</a>], reenabled disabled accounts [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1098/" title="Account Manipulation">T1098</a>], and used Mimikatz [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0002/" title="Mimikatz">S0002</a>] on Windows systems to gather credentials [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1003/" title="OS Credential Dumping">T1003</a>] and escalate privileges to SYSTEM [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1068/" title="Exploitation for Privilege Escalation">T1068</a>]. Affiliates then moved laterally inside the network through methods including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1021/001/" title="Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol">T1021.001</a>], PsExec [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0029/" title="PsExec">S0029</a>], Anydesk [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1219/" title="Remote Access Software">T1219</a>], Connectwise, N-Able, Cobalt Strike [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0154/" title="Cobalt Strike">S0154</a>], Metasploit, or other widely used command-and-control (C2) methods.</p>
<h3>Data Exfiltration</h3>
<p>Data exfiltration methods depend heavily on the affiliate conducting the network compromise. The ransomware binary does not normally include any mechanism for data exfiltration. Data exfiltration has been observed through the usage of tools such as PuTTY [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1048/002/" title="Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol">T1048.002</a>], Amazon AWS S3 buckets/tools [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1537/" title="Transfer Data to Cloud Account">T1537</a>], HTTP POST requests [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1048/003/" title="Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol">T1048.003</a>], WinSCP, Rclone, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and other methods.</p>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>RansomHub ransomware has typically leveraged an Elliptic Curve Encryption algorithm called Curve 25519 to encrypt user accessible files on the system [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1486/" title="Data Encrypted for Impact">T1486</a>]. Curve 25519 uses a public/private key that is unique to each victim organization. To successfully encrypt files that are currently in use, the ransomware binary will typically attempt to stop the following processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"vmms.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"msaccess.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"mspub.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"svchost.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"vmcompute.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"notepad.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"ocautoupds.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"ocomm.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"ocssd.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"oracle.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"onenote.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"outlook.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"powerpnt.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"explorer.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"sql.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"steam.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"synctime.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"vmwp.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"thebat.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"thunderbird.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"visio.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"winword.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"wordpad.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"xfssvccon.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"TeamViewer.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"agntsvc.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"dbsnmp.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"dbeng50.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"encsvc.exe"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The ransomware binary will attempt to encrypt any files that the user has access to, including user files and networked shares.</p>
<p>RansomHub implements intermittent encryption, encrypting files in 0x100000 byte chunks and skipping every 0x200000 bytes of data in between encrypted chunks. Files smaller than 0x100000 bytes in size are completely encrypted. Files are appended with 58 (0x3A) bytes of data at the end. This data contains a value which is likely part of an encryption/decryption key. The structure of the appended 0x3A bytes is listed below with images from three different encrypted files.</p>

<p>The ransomware executable does not typically encrypt executable files.&nbsp;A random file extension is added to file names and a ransom note generally titled <code>How To Restore Your Files.txt</code> is left on the compromised system. To further inhibit system recovery, the ransomware executable typically leverages the <code>vssadmin.exe</code> program to delete volume shadow copies [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1490/" title="Inhibit System Recovery">T1490</a>].</p>

<h2><strong>Incident Response</strong></h2>
<p>If compromise is detected, organizations should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quarantine or take potentially affected hosts offline.</li>
<li>Reimage compromised hosts.</li>
<li>Provision new account credentials.</li>
<li>Collect and review artifacts such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.</li>
<li>Report the compromise to CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (<a href="mailto:report@cisa.gov" title="Report to CISA">report@cisa.gov</a> or 888-282-0870). State, local, tribal, or territorial government entities can also report to the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) (<a href="mailto:SOC@cisecurity.org" title="Report to MS-ISAC">SOC@cisecurity.org</a> or 866-787-4722).</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>
<h3>Network Defenders</h3>
<p>The authoring organizations recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve cybersecurity posture based on RansomHub’s activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals" title="Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals">Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals</a> for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Require all accounts with password logins</strong> <strong>(e.g., service accounts, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to comply with&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/" title="Digital Identity Guidelines">National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards</a><strong> for developing and managing password policies.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length;</li>
<li>Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers;</li>
<li>Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials;</li>
<li>Avoid reusing passwords;</li>
<li>Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts;</li>
<li>Disable password “hints”; and</li>
<li>Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.<br /><strong>Note:</strong> NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.</li>
<li>Require administrator credentials to install software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E)" title="Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities (1.E)">CPG 1.E</a>]. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems.</li>
<li><strong>Require Phishing-Resistant multifactor authentication to administrator accounts</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#PhishingResistantMultifactorAuthenticationMFA2H" title="Phishing-Resistant Multifactor Authentication (MFA) (2.H)">CPG 2.H</a>] and require standard MFA for all services to the extent possible (particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems).</li>
<li><strong>Segment networks</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NetworkSegmentation2F" title="Network Segmentation (2.F)">CPG 2.F</a>] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.</li>
<li><strong>Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A" title="Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)">CPG 3.A</a>]. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.</li>
<li><strong>Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus</strong> <strong>software on all hosts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Implement Secure Logging Collection and Storage Practices&nbsp;</strong>[<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#LogCollection2T" title="Log Collection (2.T)">CPG 2.T</a>].<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Learn more about logging best practices by referencing <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/logging-made-easy" title="Logging Made Easy">CISA’s Logging Made Easy</a> resources.</li>
<li><strong>Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories</strong> for new and/or unrecognized accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Audit user accounts</strong> with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.</li>
<li><strong>Disable unused ports.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Implement and enforce email security policies</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#EmailSecurity2M" title="Email Security (2.M)">CPG 2.M</a>].</li>
<li><strong>Disable macros by default</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DisableMacrosbyDefault2N" title="Disable Macros by Default (2.N)">CPG 2.N</a>].</li>
<li><strong>Consider adding an email banner to emails</strong> received from outside your organization.</li>
<li><strong>Disable hyperlinks in received emails.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.</strong> For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.</li>
<li><strong>Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.</strong> Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E" title="System Backups (2.R)">CPG 2.R</a>]. By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure all backup data is encrypted,</strong> immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The above mitigations apply to enterprises and critical infrastructure organizations with on-premises or hybrid environments. Recognizing that insecure software is the root cause of many of these flaws and that the responsibility should not be on the end user, CISA urges software manufacturers to implement the following to reduce the prevalence of identified or exploited issues (e.g., misconfigurations, weak passwords, and other weaknesses identified and exploited through the assessment team):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embed security into product architecture</strong> throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).</li>
<li><strong>Mandate MFA, ideally phishing-resistant MFA, for privileged users</strong> and make MFA a default, rather than opt-in, feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>These mitigations align with tactics provided in the joint guide <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design" title="Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software">Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software</a>. CISA urges software manufacturers to take ownership of improving the security outcomes of their customers by applying these and other secure by design tactics. By using secure by design tactics, software manufacturers can make their product lines secure “out of the box” without requiring customers to spend additional resources making configuration changes, purchasing security software and logs, monitoring, and making routine updates.</p>
<p>For more information on secure by design, see CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign" title="Secure by Design">Secure by Design</a> webpage.</p>
<h2><strong>Validate Security Controls</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your organization’s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring organizations recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&amp;CK techniques described in this advisory.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select an ATT&amp;CK technique described in this advisory (see<strong>&nbsp;Table 6–Table 17</strong>).</li>
<li>Align your security technologies against the technique.</li>
<li>Test your technologies against the technique.</li>
<li>Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance.</li>
<li>Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.</li>
<li>Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.</li>
</ol>
<p>CISA, FBI, MS-ISAC, and HHS recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques identified in this advisory.</p>

<h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2>
<p>Your organization has no obligation to respond or provide information to the FBI in response to this joint advisory. If, after reviewing the information provided, your organization decides to provide information to the FBI, reporting must be consistent with applicable state and federal laws.</p>
<p>The FBI is interested in any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.</p>
<p>Additional details of interest include a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host- and network-based indicators.</p>
<p>The authoring organizations do not encourage paying a ransom, as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI’s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice" title="Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3)">Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3)</a>, a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices" title="Field Offices">local FBI Field Office</a>, or CISA via the agency’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/report" title="Report to CISA">Incident Reporting System</a> or its 24/7 Operations Center (<a href="mailto:report@cisa.gov)" title="Report to CISA">report@cisa.gov</a>) or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhj_ZBIQzOAPBvGALxcLtEBgh3aMfk-heWaV3T_mIMI29LLFFy8JHnS5pB2HLMaeL10rHz92dEjpXJF_7Il41mVxXZgKwEsf_vDAQwGOdGmyfEXTWcWg0SJaZylM7GS2LxWNXCGlPs_8YzHZ3-bk3CajI3uJmWMJ_MoIHgPX2owMuGt1nlQPWjO7_g7LjY/s4576/pexels-pixabay-60504.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhj_ZBIQzOAPBvGALxcLtEBgh3aMfk-heWaV3T_mIMI29LLFFy8JHnS5pB2HLMaeL10rHz92dEjpXJF_7Il41mVxXZgKwEsf_vDAQwGOdGmyfEXTWcWg0SJaZylM7GS2LxWNXCGlPs_8YzHZ3-bk3CajI3uJmWMJ_MoIHgPX2owMuGt1nlQPWjO7_g7LjY/s600/pexels-pixabay-60504.jpg" width="600" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The prevalence of software supply chain attacks is on the rise, posing significant threats due to the extensive impact and severity of such incidents, according to threat intelligence researchers at Cyble.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Within a six-month span from February to mid-August, Cyble identified 90 claims of supply chain breaches made by cybercriminals on the dark web. This averages nearly one breach every other day. Supply chain attacks are notably more costly and damaging than other types of cyber breaches, making even a small number of these attacks particularly detrimental.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cyble’s blog highlights that while infiltrations of an IT supplier’s codebase—similar to the SolarWinds incident in 2020 and Kaseya in 2021—are relatively uncommon, the software supply chain’s various components, including code, dependencies, and applications, remain a continuous source of vulnerabilities. These persistent risks leave all organizations exposed to potential cyberattacks.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Even when supply chain breaches do not compromise codebases, they can still result in the exposure of sensitive data, which attackers can exploit to breach other environments through methods such as phishing, spoofing, and credential theft. The interconnected nature of the physical and digital supply chain means that any manufacturer or supplier involved in downstream distribution could be considered a potential cyber risk, according to the researchers.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In their 2024 analysis, Cyble researchers examined the frequency and characteristics of supply chain attacks and explored defenses that can mitigate these risks.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Increasing Frequency of Supply Chain Attacks</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cyble’s dark web monitoring revealed 90 instances of cybercriminals claiming successful supply chain breaches between February and mid-August 2024.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">IT service providers were the primary targets, accounting for one-third of these breaches. Technology product companies were also significantly impacted, experiencing 14 breaches. The aerospace and defense, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors followed, each reporting between eight and nine breaches.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Despite the concentration of attacks in certain industries, Cyble’s data shows that 22 out of 25 sectors tracked have experienced supply chain attacks in 2024. The U.S. led in the number of breaches claimed on the dark web, with 31 incidents, followed by the UK with 10, and Germany and Australia with five each. Japan and India each reported four breaches.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Significant Supply Chain Attacks in 2024</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cyble’s blog detailed eight notable attacks, ranging from codebase hijacks affecting over 100,000 sites to disruptions of essential services. Examples include:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ul><li>jQuery Attack: In July, a supply chain attack targeted the JavaScript npm package manager, using trojanized versions of jQuery to exfiltrate sensitive form data from websites. This attack impacted multiple platforms and highlighted the urgent need for developers and website owners to verify package authenticity and monitor code for suspicious modifications.</li><li>Polyfill Attack: In late June, a fake domain impersonated the Polyfill.js library, injecting malware into over 100,000 websites. This malware redirected users to unauthorized sites, underscoring the security risks associated with external code libraries and the importance of vigilant website security.</li><li>Programming Language Breach: The threat actor IntelBroker claimed unauthorized access to a node package manager (npm) and GitHub account related to an undisclosed programming language, including private repositories with privileges to push and clone commits.</li><li>CDK Global Inc. Attack: On June 19, a ransomware attack targeted CDK Global Inc., a provider of software to automotive dealerships, disrupting sales and inventory operations for weeks across North American auto dealers, including major networks like Group1 Automotive Inc. and AutoNation Inc.</li><li>Access to 400+ Companies: IntelBroker also claimed in June to have access to over 400 companies through a compromised third-party contractor, with data access to platforms like Jira, GitHub, and AWS, potentially affecting large organizations such as Lockheed Martin and Samsung.</li></ul></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mitigating Supply Chain Risks through Zero Trust and Resilience</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">To counter supply chain attacks, Cyble researchers recommend adopting zero trust principles, enhancing cyber resilience, and improving code security. Key defenses include:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ol><li>Network microsegmentation</li><li>Strong access controls</li><li>Robust user and device identity authentication</li><li>Encrypting data both at rest and in transit</li><li>Ransomware-resistant backups that are “immutable, air-gapped, and isolated”</li><li>Honeypots for early detection of breaches</li><li>Secure configuration of API and cloud service connections</li><li>Monitoring for unusual activity using tools like SIEM and DLP</li><li>Regular audits, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing are also essential for maintaining these controls.</li></ol></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Enhancing Secure Development and Third-Party Risk Management</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cyble also emphasizes best practices for code security, including developer audits and partner assessments. The use of threat intelligence services like Cyble’s can further aid in evaluating partner and vendor risks.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence module assesses partner security across various areas, such as cyber hygiene, dark web exposure, and network vulnerabilities, providing specific recommendations for improvement. Their AI-powered vulnerability scanning also helps organizations identify and prioritize their own web-facing vulnerabilities.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As security becomes a more critical factor in purchasing decisions, vendors will likely need to improve their security controls and documentation to meet these demands, the report concludes.</div>

<title>ATT&amp;CK v15 Brings the Action</title>
<link>https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-v15-26685f300acc?source=rss----6da19bd08fba---4</link>
<guid>https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-v15-26685f300acc?source=rss----6da19bd08fba---4</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3>ATT&amp;CK v15 Brings the Action: Upgraded Detections, New Analytic Format, &amp; Cross-Domain Adversary Insights</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9nefc6VVPUZWdnO9pxLoTA.png" /></figure><p>v15 is all about actionability and bringing defenders’ reality into focus — we prioritized <em>what </em>you need to detect, and <em>how </em>you can do it more effectively with detection engineering upgrades, and deeper intelligence insights across platforms. This release also reflects the new expansion rhythm, balancing both well-known and emerging behaviors to reflect how trends and activity are experienced in the field.</p><p>For the details on our updates/additions across Techniques, Software, Groups and Campaigns take a look at our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2024/index.html">release notes</a>, our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/changelogs/v14.1-v15.0/changelog-detailed.html">detailed changelog</a>, or our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/changelogs/v14.1-v15.0/changelog.json">changelog.json</a>.</p><h3><strong>Enterprise | Familiar + Novel = Reality</strong></h3><p>With v15 we were aiming for the perfect balance of familiar behaviors you’ve probably seen countless times (e.g., <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013/">T1027.013: Obfuscated Files or Information: Encrypted/ Encoded File</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1665/">T1665: Hide Infrastructure</a>), as well as newer, emerging trends. The shadowy domain of Resource Development was expanded to illuminate how adversaries are using generative artificial intelligence tools, like large language models (LLMs), to support various malicious activities (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/007/">T1588.007: Obtain Capabilities: Artificial Intelligence</a>). And it’s not just about gaining initial access anymore — we added <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/008/">T1584.008: Compromise Infrastructure: Network Devices</a> to capture how threat groups are hacking into third-party network devices, including small office/home office routers, to use these devices to facilitate further targeting.</p><h3><strong>Cloud | More Actionability</strong></h3><p>As outlined in the <a href="/mitre-attack/attack-2024-roadmap-8dfc46d1ad1b">ATT&amp;CK 2024 Roadmap</a>, we’re striving to make the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/">Cloud matrix</a> more approachable for defenders of all skill levels. With this release, we focused on providing a broader set of defensive measures, resources, and insights for CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Identity. v15 features new mitigations and data sources on token protection, along with more specific references to Okta logs. <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072/">T1072: Software Deployment Tools</a> was expanded to include broad execution of <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1651/">T1651: Cloud Administration Command</a>, reflecting how threat actors are turning cloud native tools like AWS Systems Manager into remote access trojans.</p><p>We ramped up resources for CI/CD pipelines and IaC, and made some refinements to Identity, with the expansion of <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/002/">T1484: Domain Policy Modification</a> to include not just Azure AD, but also other identity-as-a-service providers like Okta. <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/">T1556: Modify Authentication Process</a> gained a new sub (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009/">T1556.009: Conditional Access Policies</a>) exploring how threat actors have tampered with or disabled conditional access policies for ongoing access to compromised accounts. We also expanded <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/003/">T1136.003: Create Account: Cloud Account</a> with additional service account insights.</p><p><strong>What’s Next:</strong> v16 will feature robust identity and detection updates, as well as the platform rebalancing operations, where we’re focusing on covering a wider range of cloud environments and threats, while making it more intuitive to prioritize techniques relevant to a specific platform.</p><h3><strong>Defensive Coverage | Upgrading, Converting &amp; Restructuring Defensive Measures</strong></h3><p>You’ll find expanded detections in v15 to assist your detection engineering. Previously, we structured our analytics in a pseudo format that was consistent with the Cyber Analytic Repository (CAR). In some cases this was hard to understand.</p><p>In v15, we transformed that format into a real-world query language style (like Splunk) that is compatible with various security tools. These upgrades are featured in detections across the framework including some techniques within the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/">Execution</a> tactic.</p><p>Our aim with these upgrades, is to reflect the data source itself is the data you should be collecting, and to provide an understandable format that pairs well with every day defender tools (i.e. SIEMs and Sensors).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TPJCF1m40g_-UQwTjlIjaw.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sP0Dsh-4G3EqqmWg77cBFw.png" /></figure><p>We have also synced up some mitigations within the parent to sub-technique relationship. Our team has analyzed a list of sub-techniques that had mitigations that the parent technique did not have. In v15, you will find some parent techniques now reflect what mitigations are seen in the sub-technique.</p><p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>As we gear up for October, we’ll be completing the Execution detections, refining Credential Access detections, diving into Cloud analytics, and restructuring our data sources for better accessibility.</p><h3><strong>ICS | Cross-Domain Campaigns</strong></h3><p>We’ve been working to retrofit major incidents in the ICS space to improve understanding and showcase how ICS and enterprise techniques intersect in each event. V15 illuminates some of the ICS-Enterprise integration efforts, with the release of four cross-mapped campaigns:</p><p>· Starting with <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0030/">Triton</a>, the Safety Instrumented System attack of 2017 that shook the petrochemical industry to its core.</p><p>· Then there’s <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0032/">C0032</a>, a campaign spanning various utilities from 2014 to 2017, often grouped with the petrochemical incident but distinctly different in nature.</p><p>· Next up, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0031/">Unitronics</a>, a spree that zeroed-in on specific devices and impacted utilities and organizations worldwide. This campaign saw adversaries disrupting device interfaces to make them unusable for end users.</p><p>· Fast forward to <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0034/">2022 Ukraine Electric Power</a>, where we witnessed a glimpse into the future of ICS attacks, with hypervisor features and shared domain access exploited to infiltrate ICS systems and unleash havoc. The campaign highlights key considerations regarding hypervisor usage across multiple domains, and the abuse of native features in vendor software.</p><p>2022 Ukraine also spawned two new ICS techniques that are featured in this release: <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0895/">T0895: Autorun Image</a> and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0894/">T0894:System Binary Proxy Execution</a> via vendor application binaries.</p><p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>v16 will launch ICS sub-techniques, along with a structured cross-walk to enable mapping between deprecated and new techniques. We’ll also be releasing new asset coverage and updates on our exploration into incorporating more sectors into the ICS matrix.</p><h3><strong>Mobile | New Techniques, Software, Groups &amp; Mitigations</strong></h3><p>With help from our community, this release incorporates new techniques, including — <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1664/">exploiting software vulnerabilities for initial access </a>and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1422/">adversaries performing active and automated discovery for the lowdown on your network setup</a> — and incorporated fresh software and groups. We also added a new mitigation to the Mobile matrix, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1059/">M1059 Do Not Mitigate</a> (for Mobile) as a sneak peek to the new mitigations that will be added in future releases. This release also features the first Mobile campaign, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0033/">C0033</a>, associated with <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0056/">PROMETHIUM (G0056)</a>. The group primarily targets Windows devices, however, recent reporting and external contributions demonstrated a shift to mobile exploitation on Android and iOS devices.</p><p>We added in Mobile techniques to existing Groups and Software to illuminate the shift to include mobile exploitation. This includes building out the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0099/">APT-C-23 (G1028)</a> profile, mirroring this South American threat group’s targeting of Android and iOS devices, and recording how <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1002/">BITTER (G1002)</a> has distributed malicious apps via SMS, WhatsApp, and various social media platforms.</p><p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>In the coming months, we’ll be rolling out more structured detections, and boosting proactivity across Mobile by evaluating incorporation of pre-intrusion techniques, like active and passive reconnaissance, and acquiring or developing resources for targeting.</p><h3><strong>Cyber Threat Intelligence | More Cybercriminal, Underrepresented Groups</strong></h3><p>We’re working towards better reflecting the threat landscape by infusing the framework with more cybercriminal and underreported adversary activity. This release showcases new cybercriminal operations and highlights <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1026/">Malteiro</a>, a criminal group believed to be based in Brazil. They are <a href="https://blog.scilabs.mx/en/cyber-threat-profile-malteiro/">known</a> for operating and distributing the Mispadu/URSA banking trojan through a malware-as-a-service model. Banking trojans, a notorious threat in Latin America, are increasingly spreading their chaos across borders, courtesy of malware developers selling tools to overseas operators. Malteiro’s operations exemplify this targeting shift, evident in a <a href="https://blog.morphisec.com/mispadu-infiltration-beyond-latam">recent campaign</a> affecting European entities across various sectors.</p><p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>We’ll continue conducting thorough assessments of Groups, Software, and Campaigns to up the framework realism quotient and provide clearer insights into adversary activities. We’re also teaming up with ATT&amp;CK domain leads to expand coverage of cross-domain intrusions.</p><h3><strong>Software Dev | TAXII 2.1, FTW</strong></h3><p>We’ve been working towards our goals of enhancing Navigator’s usability and streamlining processes for ATT&amp;CK Workbench. Most importantly, we’re taking our TAXII server to new heights, and by December 18, we’ll be retiring the TAXII 2.0 server and transitioning to the upgraded TAXII 2.1 version. You can locate the documentation for the TAXII 2.1 server in our <a href="http://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>We’ll be continuing to<strong> </strong>enhance usability on ATT&amp;CK Workbench and Navigator, and building towards swifter Groups and Software releases. Mark your calendars to update the URLs for TAXII 2.1 clients to connect to <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/">https://attack-taxii.mitre.org</a> instead of <a href="https://cti-taxii.mitre.org/">https://cti-taxii.mitre.org</a>!</p><h3><strong>In Conclusion | Field Reports, Benefactors</strong></h3><p>We’re always on the lookout for field reports and insights from those of you on the ground.

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A Google Cloud Storage bucket leak has brought renewed attention to the risk of misconfigured cloud storage buckets, one of the most common cloud security issues and causes of data leaks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Alice’s Table, a former contestant on ABC’s Shark Tank, apparently inadvertently leaked more than <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/google-cloud-leak-alices-table/">37,000 files</a> from a misconfigured Google Cloud Storage bucket, including personally identifiable information (PII) of more than 83,000 customers, such as full names, email addresses, and home addresses.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some of the accounts were associated with organizations, ranging from Pfizer, PwC, and Charles Schwab to government accounts. The information could be used for malicious purposes, such as phishing and identity theft.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The leak underscores the importance of cloud storage bucket access control, and regularly auditing permissions and monitoring for data leaks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cloud storage bucket misconfigurations are surprisingly common – Cyble's <a href="https://search.odin.io/exposed-buckets?query=provider%253A%2522gcp%2522">Odin vulnerability search tool</a> is currently detecting more than 332,000 exposed AWS storage buckets and more than 168,000 Google Cloud Storage exposures.</p>

<p>We look at best practices and options for cloud storage access management – and ways to detect unintended or malicious access.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cloud Storage Bucket Access and Configuration Best Practices</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We don’t know exactly what went wrong in the Alice’s Table data exposure, but managing access to cloud storage buckets is a tricky practice that even the largest organizations can get wrong. We’ll look at access control options for cloud storage buckets in Google Cloud, how to make a bucket or objects readable to the public as securely as possible, and options for monitoring and detecting exposed buckets and data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Restrict Storage Bucket Access By Default</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The best way to secure a Google Cloud Storage bucket is to not make it public in the first place. Access to Cloud Storage buckets is restricted by default, but there may be legitimate reasons why users would want to make a bucket public.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google Cloud Storage offers two means for controlling access to storage buckets: Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Access Control Lists (ACL). IAM is the preferred method for securing buckets, but ACLs can be used to configure access for specific objects in a bucket.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google recommends <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uniform-bucket-level-access">uniform bucket-level access</a>, which disables ACLs and makes IAM the exclusive means for access control. The more fine-grained approach of using IAM and ACLs together poses a great risk of exposing data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-access-prevention">Public access prevention</a> is perhaps the strongest level of control, as it overrides IAM and ACL.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Making a Cloud Storage Bucket Readable to the Public</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To make all objects in a bucket readable to everyone on the public internet, you can &nbsp;grant the principal <em>allUsers</em> the Storage Object Viewer (<em>roles/storage.objectViewer</em>) role, which includes the permission required to list the objects in the bucket, but a safer approach is to grant the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles#legacy-roles">Storage Legacy Object Reader</a> role (<em>roles/storage.legacyObjectReader</em>) so users can access objects without listing them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another way to balance access and risk is to use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/managed-folders">managed folders</a>, which allow fine-grained access to specific groups of objects with a bucket.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Detecting Exposed Cloud Storage Buckets</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There’s no easy way to detect exposed cloud storage buckets (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-logs">usage logs</a> are one possible option), so routine audits of bucket access permissions – and potentially removing permissions for <em>allUsers</em> and <em>allAuthenticatedUsers</em> – is a critically important practice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Data loss prevention (DLP) tools can help you identify where you have sensitive data stored that needs to be protected, and cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools can help you identify configuration issues.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Other important cloud storage security and compliance practices include object versioning, object encryption, and retention and lifecycle management.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble Odin can help organizations detect exposed cloud storage buckets, and dark web monitoring tools such as those from <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/dark-web-monitoring/">Cyble</a> can give organizations an early warning when leaks do occur so they can respond faster and take action to secure accounts and data.</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Takeaways&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Attacks on the software supply chain have occurred at a rate of at least one every two days in 2024.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>U.S. companies and IT providers have been by far the most frequent targets, accounting for one-third of all software supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The UK, Australia, Germany, India and Japan have also been frequent targets, as have the aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare and manufacturing sectors.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>These <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/">cyber attacks</a> are particularly damaging and costly because of their multiplication factor on downstream victims and trusted access to customer environments.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Even when the codebase isn’t breached, customer databases contain critical information for threat actors to use in phishing, spoofing and credential attacks. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>A defense-in-depth approach is required to reduce risk, based on principles of <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-zero-trust-framework/">zero trust</a>, cyber resilience, and secure code practices.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Software supply chain attacks burst into public consciousness in 2020 with news of the SolarWinds Orion attack, and a Kaseya VSA ransomware attack in mid-2021 further underscored the risks that third-party software suppliers can pose to their unsuspecting customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Attacks resulting from infiltration of an IT supplier’s code base are relatively rare, but the software supply chain – the code, dependencies and applications that all modern organizations rely on – is a source of near-constant vulnerabilities and cyberattacks that place all organizations at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of their trusted access to IT environments, a category of security tools called third-party risk management (TPRM) has evolved to monitor the security of trusted providers – and to alert downstream users when the risk from these services has increased.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of their trusted access to customer environments, third-party providers are one of the biggest targets for threat actors. While codebase breaches are relatively rare, a breach of any partner’s business environment can lead to sensitive data being leaked that could give attackers a critical advantage in breaching other environments, including <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-phishing/">phishing</a>, spoofing and credential attacks. And because of the interconnectedness and increasing digital nature of the physical supply chain, any manufacturer or supplier with downstream distribution can be considered a cyber risk. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We’ll look at the frequency and nature of supply chain attacks in 2024 before we focus on important defenses that all organizations with trusted partners should have in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Common Are Software Supply Chain Attacks?&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Successful supply chain attacks have become a near-daily occurrence in 2024, according to Cyble <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-cyber-threat-intelligence/">threat intelligence</a> data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble’s <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/dark-web-monitoring/">dark web monitoring</a> found 90 cybercriminal claims of successful supply chain attacks in a six-month period that encompassed February 2024 to mid-August 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not surprising given their reach, IT providers suffered the greatest number of those breaches, 30, or one-third of the total, followed by technology product companies, which experienced 14 of the 90 breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aerospace &amp; defense (9 breaches), manufacturing (9 breaches), and healthcare (8 breaches) were the next most frequent victims of supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In all, 22 of the 25 sectors tracked by Cyble threat researchers have experienced a supply chain attack in 2024 (chart below).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":56651,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The U.S. experienced by far the greatest number of supply chain breaches claimed on the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-the-dark-web/">dark web</a> – 31 in all – followed by the UK (10). Germany and Australia each had five, and Japan and India had four each.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Look at the Nature of Supply Chain Attacks in 2024&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Supply chain attacks in 2024 have ranged from the theft of business and customer data to the theft and hijacking of source code, but regardless of the sensitive data access, all such attacks pose a serious threat because of the reach of these suppliers. A recent report from Cyentia found that 99% of Global 2000 companies are directly connected to a vendor that has been hit by a supply chain breach. Here is a look at the range and nature of supply chain attacks and breaches thus far in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">jQuery&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 5, a supply chain attack on the JavaScript npm package manager involving trojanized versions of jQuery was discovered by cybersecurity researchers. The attack targeted the popular JavaScript library jQuery by distributing trojanized versions through npm, GitHub, and jsDelivr. The attackers modified the legitimate jQuery code to exfiltrate sensitive form data from websites. The attack's scope was significant, impacting multiple platforms and package names. The attackers used tactics like obfuscation and misleading version warnings. The attack underscored the urgent need for developers and website owners to verify package authenticity and scrutinize code for suspicious modifications to mitigate supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Polyfill&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In late June, a widespread supply chain attack hit over 100,000 websites, including many well-known names, originating from a fake domain that impersonated the Polyfill.js library to inject malware that redirected users to sports betting or pornographic sites. The malware dynamically generated based on HTTP headers, making detection challenging. The attack highlighted the risks of using external code libraries and the importance of vigilance in website security. Mitigation steps included removing cdn.polyfill.io, replacing it with secure alternatives, and caution against relying on unknown entities for JavaScript. The incident underscored the security implications of third-party scripts and the potential for malicious takeovers of widely deployed projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Programming Language Breach&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 26, <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/">threat actor </a>(TA) IntelBroker, posting on the BreachForums cybercrime forum, claimed to offer unauthorized access to a node package manager (npm) and GitHub account pertaining to an undisclosed programming language, for US $20,000. The TA said the offer also includes access to the X (Twitter) account of the associated organization with about 100,000 followers, and private repositories with privileges to push and clone commits. Below is a screenshot of the TA’s claims: </p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CDK Global Inc.&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 19, automotive dealership software provider CDK Global Inc. was hit by a <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack reportedly perpetrated by the Black Suit ransomware group that disrupted sales and inventory operations of many North American auto dealers, including large dealer networks belong to Group1 Automotive Inc., AutoNation Inc., Premier Truck Group, and Sonic Automotive, all of which informed U.S. authorities that they experienced a multi-week service outage and disruption to dealership operations, including those supporting sales, customer relationship management systems, inventory and accounting functions. However, none of the CDK Global customers reported any malicious activity within their networks, suggesting the attack may have been limited to a service disruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Insula Group Pty Ltd.&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 25, BianLian ransomware group claimed to compromise Australia-based Insula Group Pty Ltd. The company provides software solutions used in residential construction and finance broking industries. The ransomware group allegedly exfiltrated 400 GB of documents that included project data, construction data, client information, server data, and company source code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Access Offered to More than 400 Companies&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 15, IntelBroker, again appearing on BreachForums, offered to sell unauthorized access to more than 400 companies compromised via an undisclosed third-party contractor. The data allegedly included access to integration services of Jira, Bamboo, Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, SSH, SFTP, DA, Zabbix, AWS S3, AWS EC2, SVN and Terraform. Additionally, the TA also provided revenue of four significant impacted organizations. Open-source research based on the companies’ revenue and location suggested the impacted organizations could be Lockheed Martin Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, General Dynamics, and Apple Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Smart-ID&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 21, the functionality of the Smart-ID electronic identification and authorization app was disrupted after a cyberattack, resulting in difficulties accessing internet banking and other e-services in Latvia, Estonia and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cartier International SNC&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On Aug 5, IntelBroker leaked data on BreachForums allegedly pertaining to Cartier International SNC, a France-based luxury goods brand. The TA said the data was stolen from the U.S,-based BORN Group, a global digital marketing agency that specializes in digital transformation and commerce solutions. The TA claimed the data was exfiltrated from AWS S3 storage and also leveraged a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, which led to the exposure of internal files, images, and source code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Code Base Injection Not Required for Supply Chain Attack&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Threat actors don’t need to inject malicious code into a tech company’s code base to hack the software supply chain – they only need to exploit a zero-day or unpatched flaw that already exists, as happened in recent attacks hitting customers of MOVEit and Ivanti. And “software dependences,” like an open-source component used in proprietary software, can also introduce vulnerabilities, further expanding the attack surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The software supply chain falls under the broader category of third-party risk management (TPRM), the partners, vendors, service providers, suppliers and contractors who can unwittingly introduce risk into an organization’s environment. A number of studies have found that more than half of all organizations have experienced a third-party breach, and these breaches tend to be more costly than incidents that occur within an organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here are some of the best practices and technologies organizations can use to protect against these growing third-party risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Zero Trust and Cyber Resilience Help Control Supply Chain Risks&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity,</a> organizations should always “assume breach” and trust no one, and this applies to third-party partners too. If security teams assume that no one can be trusted and that no one can be given safe access to assets, they architect accordingly, with critical systems and data isolated with security controls and duplicated with ransomware-resistant backups.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The concept of <em>cyber resilience</em> has been repeatedly stressed in recent years. Instead of focusing solely on the network perimeter and endpoints, resilience and recovery should be built around critical applications and data using practices such as:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Network microsegmentation&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Strong access controls, allowing no more access than is required, with frequent verification&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>A strong source of user identity and authentication, including multi-factor authentication and biometrics, <em>and</em> machine authentication with device compliance and health checks&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Encryption of data at rest and in transit&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Ransomware-resistant backups that are immutable, air-gapped and isolated as much as possible&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Honeypots that lure attackers to fake assets for early breach detection&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Proper configuration of API and cloud service connections&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Monitor for unusual activity with SIEM, Active Directory monitoring, and data loss prevention (DLP) tools&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Routinely assessing and confirming controls through audits, vulnerability scanning and penetration tests&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Practices for Secure Development – and Third-Party Risk Management&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ideally, the most effective place to control software supply chain risks is in the continuous integration and development (CI/CD) process – and customers of these services also have a role to play here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Carefully vetting your partners and suppliers and requiring good security controls in contracts are ways to improve third-party security. <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/cyber-threat-intelligence/">Cyber threat intelligence</a> services like Cyble will help you assess partner and vendor risk – and alert you to places where you may want to shore up your own security defenses. Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence module evaluates partner security in areas such as cyber hygiene, dark web exposure, spoofing activities, and attack surface and network exposure, noting specific areas for improvement, while Cyble’s AI-powered vulnerability scanning capabilities can help you find and prioritize your own web-facing vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a number of guides on supply chain risk management and best practices. These are important resources both for developers and companies evaluating third-party providers. Make security reviews and requirements part of your procurement process from the start.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here are some questions you should ask vendors and service providers as part of a digital supply chain risk assessment:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Is the vendor’s software and hardware design process documented, repeatable and measurable?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Does the vendor maintain a software component inventory such as a software bill of materials (SBOM) that spells out the components and other attributes of software developed by the vendor and third parties?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Is the mitigation of known vulnerabilities factored into product design through product architecture, run-time protection techniques, and code review?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How does the vendor stay current on emerging vulnerabilities? What are vendor capabilities to address new <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/zero-day-exploit/">“zero day” vulnerabilities?</a>&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What controls are in place to manage and monitor production processes?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How is configuration management performed? Quality assurance? How is testing done for code quality and vulnerabilities?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What levels of <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/">malware </a>protection and detection are performed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What steps are taken to make sure products are tamper-proof? Are the back doors closed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Are physical security measures documented and audited?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What access controls, both cyber and physical, are in place? Are they documented and audited?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How is customer data protected, stored, retained, and destroyed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What type of employee background checks are conducted and how frequently?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What security practice expectations are there for upstream suppliers, and how is adherence to these standards assessed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How secure is the distribution process? Have approved and authorized distribution channels been clearly documented?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Services like Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence can help you get started on this process. As more organizations make security a buying criterion, vendors will be forced to respond with better security controls and documentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>A sophisticated cloud extortion campaign used misconfigured .env files in 110,000 domains to steal AWS credentials and ransom S3 cloud storage data.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The threat actors obtained AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) access keys by scanning for exposed&nbsp;.env&nbsp;files hosted on unsecured web applications. These environment variable files (.env&nbsp;files) define configuration variables within applications and platforms and often contain secrets.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Cyble’s<a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-cyber-threat-intelligence/"> threat intelligence</a> platform suggests that .env exposures&nbsp;may be more common than even this largescale attack suggests.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The IAM credentials uncovered by the attackers had permissions to create new IAM roles and attach IAM policies to existing roles, which they used to create new IAM resources with unlimited access.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/large-scale-cloud-extortion-operation/">extortion campaign</a> targeted misconfigured environment variable files (.env files) in more than 100,000 domains to steal AWS credentials and ransom data stored in S3 containers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The sophisticated campaign employed automation techniques and extensive knowledge of cloud architecture to increase the speed and success of the campaign, underscoring the need for cloud security best practices such as robust authentication and access controls, data encryption, secure configuration management, and monitoring and logging.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attackers were able to leverage .env&nbsp;files that contained sensitive information such as credentials from numerous applications because of multiple security failures on the part of cloud users. These insecure practices include:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Exposed environment variables</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Use of long-lived credentials</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Absence of a least privilege architecture</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After achieving initial access, the attack campaign set up its infrastructure within organizations’ AWS environments and from there scanned more than 230 million unique targets for sensitive information.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The campaign targeted 110,000 domains, resulting in more than 90,000 unique variables in the&nbsp;.env&nbsp;files. Of those variables, 7,000 belonged to organizations' cloud services and 1,500 variables were traced back to social media accounts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Attackers used multiple networks and tools in their operation, such as virtual private server (VPS) endpoints, the onion router (Tor) network for reconnaissance and initial access operations, and VPNs for lateral movement and data exfiltration.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Attackers successfully ransomed data hosted within cloud storage containers. They did not encrypt the data before ransom, but instead exfiltrated it and placed a ransom note in the compromised container.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Environment files let users define configuration variables used within applications and platforms, and often contain secrets such as hard-coded cloud access keys, SaaS API keys and database login information, which the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/v">threat actors</a> used for initial access.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By scanning for exposed&nbsp;.env&nbsp;files hosted on unsecured web applications, the threat actors were able to obtain exposed AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp;access keys.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How common are .env file exposures? Perhaps much greater than even this campaign would suggest – <a href="https://cyble.com/products/cyble-vision/">Cyble’s threat intelligence platform</a> has detected 1,472,925 .env files since 1 Jan 2024 that have been exposed publicly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The IAM credentials uncovered by the attackers in this case did not have administrator access to all cloud resources, but the attackers discovered that the IAM role used for initial access had permissions to create new IAM roles and attach IAM policies to existing roles. Using these capabilities, the attackers successfully escalated their privileges within victim cloud environments by creating new IAM resources with unlimited access.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the discovery phase of this campaign, the attackers ran the GetCallerIdentity API call to verify the identity of the user or role assigned to the exposed IAM credential, including UserID, AWS account number and Amazon Resource Name (ARN).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attackers also used the AWS API request ListUsers to obtain a list of IAM users in the AWS account, and the API request ListBuckets to identify all existing S3 buckets.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To elevate privileges, the attackers created an IAM role named lambda-ex with the API request CreateRole, then used the API call AttachRolePolicy to attach the AWS-managed policy AdministratorAccess to the newly created lambda-ex role.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the execution phase, the attackers initially failed to create an EC2 infrastructure stack, but using the CreateFunction20150331 API call, they were able to create new AWS Lambda functions for their automated scanning operation. From there, they were able to launch a bash script to scan for targets.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The shared responsibility model of cloud security places responsibility for secure configuration squarely on the service’s users. This cloud extortion campaign reveals the dangers that arise when cloud service users fail to follow best practices such as robust authentication and access controls, data encryption, secure configuration management, and monitoring and logging.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Exposed .env files may contain API keys and secrets, database credentials, encryption keys, and sensitive environment configurations, so the following best practices are recommended:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>Don’t commit .env files to version control</strong>: Adding .env files to .gitignore or similar mechanisms in version control systems will help prevent inadvertent exposure.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>Use environment variables</strong>: Use environment variables directly in the deployment environment to avoid relying on .env files.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>Access control</strong>: Access to .env files should be limited to those who require it.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>Audits</strong>: Regularly audit repositories and environment configurations to make sure that .env files and their contents are not exposed.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>Secrets management tools</strong>: Secrets management tools can help you store and manage sensitive information securely instead of relying on plain text files like .env.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
