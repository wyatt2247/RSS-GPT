The company has rolled out an update to fix the issue and reassured users that there is no evidence of unverified access to their data. This move follows reports from cybersecurity experts who identified a possible weakness in Slack's AI capabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The security concern was first brought to attention by PromptArmor, a cybersecurity firm that specialises in identifying vulnerabilities in AI systems. The firm raised alarms over the potential misuse of Slack’s AI functions, particularly those involving ChatGPT. These AI tools were intended to improve user experience by summarising discussions and assisting with quick replies. However, PromptArmor warned that these features could also be manipulated to access private conversations through a method known as "prompt injection."</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker tricks the AI into executing harmful commands that are hidden within seemingly harmless instructions. According to PromptArmor, this could allow unauthorised individuals to gain access to private messages and even conduct phishing attacks. The firm also noted that Slack's AI could potentially be coerced into revealing sensitive information, such as API keys, which could then be sent to external locations without the knowledge of the user.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PromptArmor outlined a scenario in which an attacker could create a public Slack channel and embed a malicious prompt within it. This prompt could instruct the AI to replace specific words with sensitive data, such as an API key, and send that information to an external site. Alarmingly, this type of attack could be executed without the attacker needing to be a part of the private channel where the sensitive data is stored.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further complicating the issue, Slack’s AI has the ability to pull data from both file uploads and direct messages. This means that even private files could be at risk if the AI is manipulated using prompt injection techniques.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Upon receiving the report, Slack immediately began investigating the issue. The company confirmed that, under specific and rare circumstances, an attacker could use the AI to gather certain data from other users in the same workspace. To address this, Slack quickly deployed a patch designed to fix the vulnerability. The company also assured its users that, at this time, there is no evidence indicating any customer data has been compromised.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In its official communication, Slack emphasised the limited nature of the threat and the quick action taken to resolve it. The update is now in place, and the company continues to monitor the situation to prevent any future incidents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are potential risks that come with integrating AI into workplace tools that need to be construed well. While AI has many upsides, including improved efficiency and streamlined communication, it also opens up new opportunities for cyber threats. It is crucial for organisations using AI to remain vigilant and address any security concerns that arise promptly.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Slack’s quick response to this issue stresses upon how imperative it is to stay proactive in a rapidly changing digital world.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /></p>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NdNL-P_jvIn29chXCd8RmA.jpeg" /></figure><h4>Enhancing usability, expanding scope, optimizing defenses</h4><p>2023 was dynamic year for ATT&amp;CK. We marked a decade of progress since the framework’s inception and achieved some key milestones to make ATT&amp;CK more accessible for a wider community. Our scope (slightly) expanded to encompass activities adjacent to direct Enterprise interactions, such as non-technical, deceptive practices and social engineering techniques (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1657/">Financial Theft</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656/">Impersonation</a>, and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/">Spearphishing Voice</a>). We enhanced detection capabilities with integrated notes, pseudocode from <a href="https://car.mitre.org/">CAR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/bzar">BZAR</a>-based analytics. The ICS matrix welcomed the addition of <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/assets/">Assets</a> to enhance inter-sector communication and mapping. We rolled out Mobile-specific <a href="http://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">data sources</a>, structured detections, and behaviors like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660/">smishing, quishing, and vishing</a>. Website navigation was improved, along with a faster Search bar, and updates that hit you faster than you can say “<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/changelog.html">resources/changelog.html</a>”. We also maintained a steady cadence of updates and new content from the ATT&amp;CK team and external contributors.</p><p>In October, we successfully held <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/learn-more-about-attack/attackcon/october-2023/">ATT&amp;CKcon 4.0</a>, with new insights shared and realistic applications demonstrated by practitioners. And finally, we kickstarted the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/engage-with-attack/benefactors/">ATT&amp;CK Benefactor program</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BMDwDsQqdUFRS-B-t7MyTA.jpeg" /><figcaption>ATT&amp;CKcon 4.0 Themed Snacks</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>2024 Roadmap: Vision &amp; Goals</strong></h3><p>Since launching ATT&amp;CK, we’ve been humbled to witness how the community has integrated it across widely varied spheres and around the globe. The vision for ATT&amp;CK has always been to enable the broadest use across the widest spectrum of stakeholders — whether you’re cross-mapping between domains, annotating and developing tailored Navigator layers, or using the framework as a blueprint to build multi-platform threat models. ATT&amp;CK was designed to empower defenders precisely where they need it most. This is the core thesis for ATT&amp;CK, and as its stewards, we’ll continue prioritizing measures that advance a more inclusive, relevant, and actionable framework.</p><p>In line with this vision, our 2024 goals are to bolster broader usability and enhance actionable defensive measures for practitioners across every domain. This includes exploring scope adjustments and platform rebalancing, as well as implementing structural modifications with the introduction of ICS sub-techniques. A core focus will be reinforcing defensive mechanisms and optimizing their user-friendliness. We’ll be bridging Linux and macOS information gaps and enhancing prominent adversary representation. The ATT&amp;CK Navigator, Workbench, and website will feature reengineering to improve accessibility and enable swifter ATT&amp;CK Group/Software/Campaign updates. We’ll also be sunsetting the TAXII 2.0 server by December 18 in favor of the upgraded TAXII 2.1 version. Finally, we’ll continue amplifying the key driver behind ATT&amp;CK — community collaboration. This includes hosting ATT&amp;CKcon 5.0 in October, and maintaining support for the <a href="https://www.attack-community.org">European Union (EU)</a> and <a href="https://na.eventscloud.com/website/67610/">Asia-Pacific (APAC) ATT&amp;CK Community</a> Workshops.</p><h3><strong>Enterprise | Integrated Defense</strong></h3><p>In tune with ATT&amp;CK’s vision, we’re continuously re-evaluating Enterprise’s scope to more accurately reflect the threats faced by real defenders. Matrices and platforms are conceptual schematics, not real-world structures, and we’re assessing realignments, expansions, and refinements of platforms to represent interconnected organizations, the adversaries they encounter, and the reality of defenders. Our goal is to advance a cohesive and integrated framework that provides more functional use cases and empowers users to visualize and create adaptable defenses against cross-platform threats.</p><p><strong>Cloud | Matrix Balance &amp; More Actionability</strong></p><p>Our Cloud goal this year is to enable defenders (both new and seasoned) to better leverage the Cloud matrix for defensive action. This includes focusing on emerging and significant threats to the domain, upgrading Cloud analytics, and optimizing the balance between generalization and detail in the matrix.</p><p>With a considerable portion of cloud identities retaining super admin access, and the frequency of identity-related intrusions across the domain, we’ve been reinforcing and creating more detailed techniques for identity-based attacks. We’ll also be diving into the exploitation of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and the malicious use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Our Cloud analytics effort will elevate your actionability, by outlining the steps to detect specific behaviors, and providing additional context on what to find and collect.</p><p>We’ll also be evaluating how to best refine the balance between abstraction and specificity in the matrix. Our exploration will assess if the platforms are broad enough to cover a wide range of cloud environments and threats, yet specific enough to inform defensive actions. This balance is crucial for the matrix to remain practical and useful for defenders operating in diverse cloud environments. Our aim is to make navigating the Cloud matrix more intuitive and enable users to prioritize techniques relevant to their specific platform.</p><p>Ready to navigate the Cloud with us? Sail over to #<a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035Z0AL8R0"><strong>cloud_attack</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>macOS/Linux | Countermeasures for Priv Esc and Defense Evasion</strong></p><p>Our goal for Linux and macOS is to equip practitioners with more robust countermeasures and help bridge the information gap on defending these systems. We’ll continue tracking down in-the-wild adversary behaviors and building more macOS and Linux-only (sub)techniques to optimize defensive arsenals. For Linux we’ll be exploring privilege escalation and defense evasion to better align with in-the-wild adversary activity. On the macOS side, we’ll be strategically bolstering the platform, with a particular emphasis on threats associated with elevated permissions.</p><p>If you have intelligence or technique ideas, we would love to collaborate. We rely on the practitioners who work with these systems day-in and day-out to help us identify gaps and provide invaluable insights. Ready to contribute? <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">email us</a> and join our <strong>#</strong><a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035BUEMMHP"><strong>linux_attack</strong></a> or <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C0351D4AU1J"><strong>#macos_attack</strong></a> slack channel.</p><h3><strong>Defensive Coverage | Upgrading, Converting &amp; Restructuring Defensive Measures</strong></h3><p>Our Defensive goal this year is to expand detections and mitigations to help you better optimize your detection engineering — and maybe get a little more actionable. The April release will include both new and updated mitigations that incorporate best practices from contributors, and industry standards meticulously mapped by our defense team.</p><p>Over the past few months, we’ve also been examining analytic language approaches. Our aim? Transforming detection logic into formats compatible with different security tools, including more consistent with real-world query languages such as Splunk . This will simplify the process of aligning your SIEM data with ATT&amp;CK detections, making it easier to understand. We’re also incorporating data collection sources for a given detection query. For example, pulling information from Windows Event logs or Sysmon and the associated Event Code. The new analytic style in ATT&amp;CK will overhal the previously used CAR-like pseudocode, and will be the model for future analytics. This will enhance compatibility across various environments and help you hunt threats more efficiently.</p><p>Lately, we’ve been prioritizing improving detections under the Execution tactic, where some of the most employed techniques fall. v15 will showcase a subset of these enhanced detections, featuring the trifecta of <a href="https://car.mitre.org/">CAR</a> (Cyber Analytics Repository) pseudocode, <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/bzar">BZAR</a>-based analytics (Bro/Zeek ATT&amp;CK-based Analytics and Reporting) and detection notes.</p><p>Gearing up for October, we’ll be completing the enhanced detections for Execution, sculpting out Credential Access detections, exploring the universe of Cloud analytics, and navigating how to restructure our data sources for improved accessibility. This means sprucing up data source definitions and matching them to everyday use cases like sensor mappings. This way, you can more easily identify the tools and events that clue you in on shady activity. Additionally, you can opt for the data sources that best align with your specific needs. The revamp will also include the introduction of STIX IDs for data components, making it more intuitive to reference and integrate data sources.</p><p>Join our ranks at <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036RA0B7EX"><strong>#defensive_attack</strong></a> channel.</p><h3><strong>ICS | Subs, Asset Expansion, &amp; Cross-Domain Integration</strong></h3><p>ICS is leveling up this year. Our goals include broadening ICS horizons with new asset coverage, exploring platform scope expansion, and continuing our multi-domain integration quest. We’ll also be diving deeper into adversary behaviors with the introduction of sub-techniques. v15 will showcase some of integration efforts, with the release of cross-mapped campaigns. These campaigns track IT to OT attack sequences, helping defenders better understand multi-domain intrusions and informing unified defense strategies across technology environments.</p><p>The October release will feature a structural shake-up, with the first tranche of the long-awaited sub-techniques. Like Enterprise and Mobile sub-techniques, ICS subs will break down techniques into more detail. This increased granularity allows defenders to understand the nuances of adversaries’ execution of a given technique, enhancing their ability to detect and mitigate them. The technique restructuring will involve modifying the name and scope of techniques and integrating them more effectively with other domains. This integration will foster a more comprehensive defensive approach on both the right and left of launch. You can expect a subs crosswalk to help you understand our decisions and how things map between deprecated and new techniques.</p><p>October will also include some additional treats with Asset coverage expansion, building upon the <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-v14-fa473603f86b">Asset refactoring in v14</a>. The refactoring strived to provide a clearer picture of the devices, systems, or platforms a specific technique could target and introduced the concept of Related Assets. Related Assets links cross-sector Assets that share similar functions, capabilities, and architectural locations/properties, highlighting that they may also be susceptible to the same techniques. v16 will feature additional Related Assets, as well as more in-depth definitions and refined mappings of technique relationships for different devices and systems. You can start leveraging Assets for your defensive activities by viewing the technique mappings from <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/assets/">Asset</a> pages, or by reviewing Asset mappings from a technique page. We’ll also be scouting how to incorporate additional sectors such as such as maritime, rail, and electric.</p><p>We welcome input from all sectors on how to improve identification of key assets and any additional adversary behaviors you have observed in the wild. Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a> or <strong>#</strong><a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C061YMN07M1"><strong>ics_attack</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Mobile | Detections &amp; Mitigations Optimization + PRE Exploration</strong></h3><p>Mobile’s goal is to dial up the pre-and-post-compromise defensive measures this year, with a detections and mitigations upgrade and an exploratory mission into pre-intrusion behaviors for the matrix. We introduced Mobile structured detections in v14 and will continue building out structured detections as well as expanding our mitigations across the matrix. For optimal actionability, we’ll be leveraging the best practices and tangible experiences from the mobile security community.</p><p>In the coming months we’ll also be evaluating how to enhance inter-domain connectivity across platforms and exploring integrating proactive tactics into the Mobile matrix. Our goal is to better reflect evolving adversary activity targeting the domain. This research quest will examine adversary actions before attacks, like active and passive <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/">Reconnaissance</a>, and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0042/">acquiring or developing resources</a> for targeting purposes.</p><p>Collaboration and knowledge-sharing with the community will to be a driver for Mobile’s development in 2024. In addition to ramping up detections and mitigations, we’re particularly interested in partnering with mobile defenders to examine potential areas where communications platforms or domains could be added into ATT&amp;CK. If you’re interested, connect via <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a> or join <strong>#</strong><a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036CEG4VRP"><strong>mobile_attack</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h3><strong>Software Development | Enhanced Usability &amp; Streamlined Workflows</strong></h3><p>Our Software goals this year are to increase usability across ATT&amp;CK Workbench and Navigator, and streamline Groups and Software releases. Adversaries evolve quickly, so we’re optimizing Workbench workflows to harmonize Group and Software releases more closely to their cadence. This includes developing enhanced search capabilities, improving ATT&amp;CK object-collection association, and overhauling the Collection Manager UI for the ATT&amp;CK Workbench. These renovations will fine-tune the approval of ATT&amp;CK object changes and the matching of collection bundle differences with official ATT&amp;CK changelog types, resulting in swifter releases.</p><p>For ATT&amp;CK Navigator, we’re refining the user experience, <em>and</em> the experience of anyone reading your reports. We’ll be upgrading SVG export function for sleeker output designs, providing smoother navigation with intuitive export controls, and rolling out an in-website tutorial for mastery of all the key features. We’ll also be updating the official content source to the STIX 2.1 repository — making everything a little more robust and flexible.</p><p>Finally, we’re taking our TAXII server to the next level! We’ll be sunsetting the TAXII 2.0 server by December 18, as we transition to the upgraded TAXII 2.1 version. You can access the documentation for TAXII 2.1 server in our <a href="http://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub repository</a>. Remember to switch URLs for TAXII 2.1 clients to connect to <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org">https://attack-taxii.mitre.org</a> instead of <a href="https://cti-taxii.mitre.org.">https://cti-taxii.mitre.org.</a> And get ready to experience enhanced features and smoother operations.</p><h3><strong>Cyber Threat Intelligence | More Cybercriminal, Underrepresented Groups</strong></h3><p>With CTI, our mission is to better reflect the reality of the threat landscape by infusing more cybercriminal and underreported adversary activity into the framework. By bridging gaps in representation and minimizing those unknowns, we aim to provide defenders with better insights and tools to counter a wider array of threats. A pivotal aspect of this effort includes gap assessments of Groups, Software, and Campaigns. These evaluations will help us pinpoint any disparities between the current content and the reality of adversary activities.</p><p>Our releases this year will feature more cybercriminal operations and under-monitored regions, including Latin America, offering a more nuanced understanding of global threats. We’re also collaborating with ATT&amp;CK domain leads to expand coverage of cross-domain intrusions to inform a more unified approach to undermining adversaries.</p><p>To join this quest, engage at <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a></p><h3><strong>Community Collaboration</strong></h3><p><strong>ATT&amp;CK Community Workshops | Practitioner-led Forums for Activating ATT&amp;CK</strong></p><p>We’re always inspired to see how ATT&amp;CK is being used in innovative ways to upgrade defensive capabilities. The regional ATT&amp;CK community workshops — organized by practitioners, for practitioners — provide forums to share insights, use cases, and collaborative approaches for leveraging ATT&amp;CK.</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.attack-community.org/event/">European Union (EU)</a> ATT&amp;CK Community workshop, hosted by the <a href="https://ccb.belgium.be/en">Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium </a>and supported by the <a href="https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/">Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID)</a> was the first regional ATT&amp;CK workshop, The 2024 iteration will take place in Brussels, Belgium on May 17, in-person and virtually.</li><li>The <a href="https://na.eventscloud.com/website/67610/">Asia-Pacific (APAC) ATT&amp;CK Community Workshop</a>, hosted by the by the <a href="https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/">CTID</a>, launches this April 25–26 in Singapore, and <a href="https://na.eventscloud.com/esurvey/index.php?surveyid=119679&amp;st=11ed3b2537a57f262963e9006f1f47b114c68f6f">virtual attendance</a> is still open. The Workshop will advance threat-informed defense through hands-on training, ATT&amp;CK best practices, worst practices, and moonshot approaches.</li></ul><p><strong>ATT&amp;CKcon 5.0 | Great Speakers, Content, &amp; Conversations around ATT&amp;CK</strong></p><p><strong>ATT&amp;CKcon 5.0 </strong>will be arriving October 22–23, featuring both virtual and in-person attendance from McLean, VA. Stay tuned to our Twitter and LinkedIn channels for updates on our Call for Presentations, which will open in the coming months, followed by our illustrious speaker lineup. If your organization is thinking about joining the ATT&amp;CKcon adventure as a sponsor, please reach out to us at attackcon@mitre.org.</p><p><strong>Benefactor Program | Empowering Defenders, Sustaining Independence</strong></p><p>We want to take a moment to share some insights into the foundational tenants and financial realities of ATT&amp;CK. Much like we crowd-source intelligence and rely on community contributions, ATT&amp;CK itself was built to be independent, responsive, and part of the global community.</p><p>From the outset, we deliberately chose not to align ATT&amp;CK with any specific government department or agency. This decision was made to maintain autonomy, flexibility, and to foster collaboration across the broadest spectrum of stakeholders. While this approach has facilitated agility and international partnerships, it also means that ATT&amp;CK lacks a dedicated funding source.</p><p>To bridge this funding gap and ensure the continuity of our operations, as well as expanding into new domains, we launched the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/engage-with-attack/benefactors/">Benefactor Program</a> last year. This program enables tax-deductible, charitable donations from individuals and organizations who believe in ATT&amp;CK’s mission. These contributions allow us to continue offering free and accessible services while also advancing our capabilities and scope.</p><p>We are <strong>immensely grateful</strong> for the support we have received thus far from initial benefactors SOC Prime, Tidal Cyber, and Zimperium. We remain committed to serving the community with transparency; whether you’re a contributor, a fellow defender, or just getting started, we thank you for being part of ATT&amp;CK’s journey.</p><h3><strong>Looking Forward</strong></h3><p>Mark your calendars for the v15 release on April 23! You’ll see some novel content interspersed with familiar elements, as well as more practical defensive measures.</p><p>As always, we value the opportunity to collaborate with you in ensuring that ATT&amp;CK remains a living framework, where each contribution, conversation, or new implementation fuels its evolution. We look forward to continuing this adventure with you.</p><p>Connect with us on <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MITREattack">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mitre-att&amp;ck/">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a>.</p><p>©2024 The MITRE Corporation.

As v14 emerges from the depths, we’re proud to present a more robust and finely-tuned knowledge base. So, grab your flashlights and keep your wits about you as you navigate the latest changes, including enhanced detection guidance for many techniques, a (slightly) expanded scope on Enterprise and Mobile, Assets in ICS, and Mobile Structured Detections.</p><p>For the rest of our regular updates/additions across Techniques, Software, Groups and Campaigns take a look at our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2023/index.html">release notes</a>, our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/changelogs/v13.1-v14.0/changelog-detailed.html">detailed changelog</a>, or our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/changelogs/v13.1-v14.0/changelog.json">changelog.json</a>.</p><h4><strong>Detection Upgrade with Analytics</strong></h4><p>In ATT&amp;CK v13 we started adding “detection notes” and pseudocode analytics from <a href="https://car.mitre.org/">CAR</a> (Cyber Analytics Repository) directly into some detections. In v14 we’ve dramatically expanded the number of techniques with a new easy button and added a new source of analytics. One focus this release was Lateral Movement, which now features over 75 <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/bzar">BZAR</a>-based analytics! <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/bzar">BZAR</a> (Bro/Zeek ATT&amp;CK-based Analytics and Reporting) is a subset of CAR analytics that enable defenders to detect and analyze network traffic for signs of ATT&amp;CK-based adversary behavior. Moving forward, we plan to continue working across tactics to enhance detection approaches.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X7qQq-oWIaajG6inaAkQaQ.png" /><figcaption>Example BZAR-derived Analytic</figcaption></figure><p>Also new: enhanced relationships between detections, data sources, and mitigations. Improving techniques is a collaborative and iterative process, and we work with the community to identify new procedures and enhance data sources and mitigations. This release includes updated technique alignments to data sources and mitigations, better reflecting the most effective defensive measures for the impacted techniques.</p><p>Jump into the <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036RA0B7EX"><strong>#defensive_attack</strong></a> channel to be part of the action.</p><h4><strong>Enterprise’s New(ish) Frontier</strong></h4><p>Since its inception, ATT&amp;CK has been dynamic, designed to catalog, categorize, and adapt to real-world adversary behaviors that primarily involve direct interaction with devices, systems, and networks. Over the past decade, this adaptability and focus has empowered defenders through consistent, threat-informed resources. As adversaries continually evolve their exploitation of human vulnerabilities, ATT&amp;CK has expanded its scope with this release, encompassing more activities that are <em>adjacent</em> to, yet lead to direct network interactions or impacts. The increased range incorporates deceptive practices and social engineering techniques that may not have a direct technical component, including Financial Theft (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1657/">T1657: Financial Theft</a>), Impersonation (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656/">T1656: Impersonation</a>), and Spearphishing Voice (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/">T1598.004: Phishing for Information: Spearphishing Voice</a>).</p><p>Think some behaviors are still missing? Your input remains essential as we continue to expand ATT&amp;CK’s horizons and refine content to match advancing adversary tactics. <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">Email</a> or <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a> us what you’re seeing.</p><h4><strong>Assets Join the ICS Arsenal</strong></h4><p>We’ve been working on Asset refactoring for a while, and we’re thrilled to introduce the results of our initial efforts. v14 features 14 inaugural <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/assets/">Assets</a>, representing the primary functional components of the systems associated with the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/ics/">ICS domain</a>. These Asset pages include in-depth definitions, meticulous mappings to techniques, and a list of related Assets. Our primary goals for Assets are to provide a common language for inter-sector communication, and to empower underrepresented sectors to leverage ATT&amp;CK mappings, fostering meaningful communication about risks and threats. You can also now find Assets on the <a href="https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/">ATT&amp;CK Navigator</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*II7dLEhjK-F5qLgq0mrd9A.jpeg" /><figcaption>The Data Gateway Asset</figcaption></figure><p>The Assets refactoring process involved an in-depth review of relevant CTI, researching and refining the resulting definitions based on industry standards, and analyzing how the device features map to ATT&amp;CK Techniques. We look forward to leveraging the deep insights from our industry partners as we continue refining and expanding Assets.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Dbt2_PI3XGs6p9b8tKN0qQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>A Partial List of Assets</figcaption></figure><p>If you’re interested in contributing, head over to the recently created<strong> #</strong><a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C061YMN07M1"><strong>ics_attack</strong></a><strong> </strong>channel.</p><h4><strong>Reeling in Mobile Threats with Phishing &amp; Structured Detections</strong></h4><p>With Enterprise increasing its scope a bit, Mobile has also expanded its coverage to include Phishing (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660/">Phishing:T1660</a>), which encompasses phishing attempts through vectors including SMS messaging (“smishing”), Quick Response (QR) codes (“quishing”), and phone calls (“vishing”). Mobile Phishing features a new mitigation (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1058">M1058: Antivirus/Antimalware</a>), to enhance anti-virus and malware defenses. Also introduced with this release, Mobile <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">structured detections</a>. This allows you to explicitly see the required inputs (Data Sources) for each detection, along with how to analyze the data to identify a specific Technique (detection).

<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PkApzI8NMYPKdGGq2ZA1Vw.png" /></figure><h3>ATT&amp;CK v13 Enters the Room: Pseudocode, Swifter Search, and Mobile Data Sources</h3><p>It’s not like a regular Tuesday, it’s a lucky Tuesday — ATT&amp;CK v13 has arrived. As we outlined in our <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/2023-attack-roadmap-452fab541673">Roadmap</a>, we’re working toward enhanced tools for lower-resourced defenders, improving ATT&amp;CK’s website usability, enhancing ICS and Mobile parity with Enterprise, and evolving overall content and structure this year. ATT&amp;CK v13 is bringing some analytics pseudocode, Mobile-specific data sources, key website updates, ICS Asset refactoring, and more Cloud and Linux coverage. For the rest of our regular updates/additions across Techniques, Software, Groups and Campaigns take a look at our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2023/index.html">release notes</a>, our (new) <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/changelogs/v12.1-v13.0/changelog-detailed.html">detailed changelog</a>, or our (new) <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/changelogs/v12.1-v13.0/changelog.json">changelog.json</a>.</p><h3>Defensive Easy Button: Pseudocode for Detection</h3><p>This release features a new defensive ‘easy button’, with the addition of <a href="https://car.mitre.org/">CAR</a> pseudocode to a number of our data components. These pseudocode analytics add more context on what you should find and collect, by describing at a high level the steps involved in detecting certain types of behaviors. You can use these analytics as a blueprint for your custom detections, leaving you with more time to spend on the defensive activities of your choice.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/838/1*qbIfAT_TjlqGitKsI1z65Q.png" /></figure><p>Moving forward we’ll be revamping Mitigations and improving defenses tactic-by-tactic, by incorporating analytics from CAR and dynamic research into the data components falling under a given tactic. If you’d like to join our efforts, <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">let us know</a> or join us in the <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036RA0B7EX"><strong>#defensive_attack</strong></a> channel.</p><h3>ATT&amp;CK’s Infrastructure: ATT&amp;CK Search 2.0 and changelog.json</h3><p>Two of our most frequently requested items are now here: faster search and machine-readable changelogs!</p><p>We’ve <strong>all</strong> experienced the patience-building opportunity associated with using the ATT&amp;CK website search, so we’re thrilled to finally introduce a new and improved search! While it won’t be breaking the sound barrier anytime soon, it will save you some serious time when you’re trying to figure out which techniques cover Import Access Table. Your initial search with the enhanced version will be in the 5-second range, with following queries resolving near instantaneously. We’ll continue to adjust this important feature and appreciate all of you who stayed with us through the search bar trials. Let us know if you spot any new corner cases!</p><p>Another significant addition to this release is a <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/changelogs/v12.1-v13.0/changelog.json">machine-readable changelog</a>. You’ll now be able to access and parse through the changelog, quickly identifying and integrating the updates. For more details check out the <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/blob/master/mitreattack/diffStix/README.md">changelog.json format details in our GitHub</a>. Our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2023/">release notes format</a> has also been improved, now documenting New, Major Version Changes, Minor Version Changes, and Patches for each of Techniques, Mitigations, Data Sources, Data Components, Software, Groups, and Campaigns. If you’re wondering what “Patches” are, it’s what we’re calling changes so minor (e.g., typos, URL fixes, grammar) no version update was necessary.</p><p>We don’t expect quite as much celebration for our ATT&amp;CK Navigator updates, but new updates coming with ATT&amp;CK v13 enable you to further customize your layer colors, scoring, image orientation and preset image sizing — for more details, check out the Navigator <a href="https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/">release notes</a> (click on the ? in the top right of Navigator).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/138/1*1N1Gp76i9hL5TaCaMl7_Kw.png" /></figure><h3>Mobile: Data Sources are Live</h3><p>On the Mobile front, you’ll now be able to access <a href="http://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">Mobile-specific Data Sources</a>! Mobile has joined the filter list along with Enterprise and ICS, enabling you to toggle between the data sources for your chosen domain(s). In addition to the new Mobile-specific sources, the cross-domain mappings with Enterprise are now more accessible. The Mobile-specific and cross-mapped sources are also listed on the individual Data Source pages.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*3qu362KQAsQCKvDZuYZUIw.png" /></figure><p>Over the next few months, we’ll continue to add to our Mobile data sources, as well as architecting <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">structured </a><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/">detections</a>.

Our Assets refactoring effort seeks to align how different industries describe assets, in order to better map device functionality to core dependencies and associate the Assets to the relevant techniques. Through this effort we’ve also been working to address gaps from underreported industries. We’ll continue to collaborate with the ICS community to better build out and describe assets and create these mappings. Our goal is to include Assets in the metadata box on technique pages to help inform defenders about a device’s susceptibility to techniques.</p><h3>Campaigns: Criminals, APTs and Cross-Mappings</h3><p>Our Campaigns game is going strong, with v13 showcasing a blend of recent cyber intrusions and those previously captured in a Group page. A couple of our more contemporary entries include APT41’s compromise of U.S. state government networks (<a href="http://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0017/">C0017</a>), and an AvosLocker ransomware-as-a-service operation (<a href="http://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0018/">C0018</a>). Some of the older activity previously featured in Groups, include APT29’s <a href="http://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0023/">Operation Ghost</a> and the <a href="http://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024/">SolarWinds</a> compromise. The star of this release, and one we’re particularly excited about, is the cross-domain Campaign entry, the <a href="http://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0025/">2016 Ukraine operation</a> by Sandworm Team. Over the next several months, we’ll continue to focus on criminal group operations and expanding on the hybrid Campaigns that traverse domains.</p><h3>Cloud: Now with More Exec and LatMo Coverage</h3><p>We assessed known gaps in the Execution and Lateral Movement tactics of the Cloud matrix and built out additions to address some of the disparities. These changes feature contributions from an ongoing partnership with the Cloud community to better represent behaviors in and against Cloud technologies, as well as reflecting how organizations are using Cloud in their operations. In the coming months, we’ll continue to expand coverage in these not-so-easy-to-capture cloud-related tactics, as well as evaluating where to develop more Exfiltration coverage.</p><p>Our end goal this year is to ensure that everyone can more effectively utilize ATT&amp;CK for Cloud. If you have ideas or contributions to share, please <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">email us</a> or drift by the #<a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035Z0AL8R0"><strong>cloud_attack</strong></a> channel on the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">ATT&amp;CK slack</a>.</p><h3>Linux: Making the Penguin a Little More Secure</h3><p>Our Linux team has spent the last few months going through contributions, coordinating with contributors, and navigating through open-source reporting for in-the-wild adversary behaviors. This release includes updated and new Linux-only (sub)techniques that will enhance the Linux defender’s toolset. We’ll continue building out Linux coverage in ATT&amp;CK, as well as gaining a better understanding of the adversaries operating in this space. If you’d like to work with us or to join our very exclusive Linux channel <strong>(#</strong><a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035BUEMMHP"><strong>linux_attack</strong></a>), we’d love to have a conversation.</p><h3>Next Up: v14 and ATT&amp;CKcon</h3><p>We know you’re still trying to catch your breath from all the v13 adjustments, but we’re still sprinting for v14! October’s release will feature upgraded coverage across domains, renovated mitigations, new cross-domain mappings, more pseudocodes, and Mobile structured detections.</p><p>We’ll also be releasing more details on ATT&amp;CKCon 4.0 soon (October 24–25), so start getting ready with some light reading/watching of previous <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/attackcon/">ATT&amp;CKcon</a> presentations or couch interviews.</p><p>As always, we look forward to connecting with you on <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MITREattack?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a>.</p><p>©2023 The MITRE Corporation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<h4>A Roadmap of 2023’s key efforts: From ICS Assets to more Linux and ATT&amp;CKcon 4.0.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pZsmRwpPNtBygO-4zxDVLQ.png" /></figure><p>It’s 2023 and we’re all a little older, including ATT&amp;CK, which will be celebrating its 8th (!) release anniversary in a few short months. Last year we matured, expanded, deconflicted, and renovated the knowledge base, persevering through challenges to meet our <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-2022-roadmap-cd5a1a3387c7">2022 goals</a>. Some of our most notable efforts including unveiling <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">Enterprise structured detections</a>, publishing <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">Mobile sub-techniques</a>, introducing <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/">ICS detections</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">transitioning ATT&amp;CK for ICS</a> to the mothership (aka attack.mitre.org), launching <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-campaigns-6b15baa6cbb4">Campaigns</a>, and hosting <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/attackcon/">ATT&amp;CKcon 3.0</a>.</p><p>The ATT&amp;CK team also trekked around the U.S. and the globe to talk about ATT&amp;CK for defenders, threat hunters, and cyber threat intelligence analysts. We held riveting conversations about purple teaming, discussed best practices for adversary emulation, and connected over common misuses of ATT&amp;CK. You inspired us with your stories, insights and expertise, and we’re thrilled to continue collaborating with you in 2023.</p><h3><strong>2023 Roadmap</strong></h3><p>Our focus areas in 2023 will be targeted growth and integration. We’ll be maintaining framework stability as we build out content and structure, while expanding and increasing the scope of some of ATT&amp;CK’s current platforms. We’ll be looking for places where we can add defensive “easy buttons” to ATT&amp;CK and other ways we can improve for lower-resourced defenders. Relatedly, we’ll also be working to enhance the usability, accessibility, and functionality of the ATT&amp;CK website and Navigator. These updates and more will be mainly centered on our April and October releases.</p><p><strong>Linux | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>We made significant progress in updating the macOS platform last year, and while we’ll continue evolving that content, we’ve officially transitioned the spotlight to Linux for 2023. April’s release will feature Linux contributions (thank you, contributors!) that focus on modifications to parent technique scope, including new sub-techniques and updated procedures.</p><p>For the October release, we’re targeting an expanded representation of Linux within ATT&amp;CK. We’re looking to not only better account for activity within on-premise Linux servers, but some of the broader Linux-based (and not always x86) spaces adversaries have been abusing. This will be a substantial effort given how under reported Linux activity is, and the Linux security community’s input is essential for us to improve this platform. We’re working to build out opportunities to connect both online and offline and would like to hear how you’d like to collaborate. In the interim, whether you have specific insights to share, or would just like to talk about ATT&amp;CK for Linux in general, email us and join the <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035BUEMMHP">#<strong>linux_attack</strong></a> channel on the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">ATT&amp;CK slack</a>.</p><p><strong>Defensive Coverage | October 2023</strong></p><p>When we added explicit pairing of <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">detections to data sources in ATT&amp;CK v11</a>, it was intended to let you identify the inputs you need to collect (Data Sources), combined with how to analyze that data to identify a given Technique (detection). We’ll be leveling up this year, exploring and including in ATT&amp;CK more specifics on what you as defenders can be collecting related to detections and how. This quest will result in an more directly usable guidance for defenders, as well as a more in-depth look at data collection, analyzation, and identification of a given technique.</p><p>We will also be assessing ATT&amp;CK mitigations for gaps and potential improvements this year. We converted mitigations into objects in v5 to increase their usability, and our goal has always been to continue to evolve and improve that knowledge base. Over the next several months, we’ll be researching new preventions and crafting out additional ways to prevent a given technique from succeeding. If you’d like to contribute to either of these quests, <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">let us know</a> or join us in the <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036RA0B7EX"><strong>#defensive_attack</strong></a> channel in our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a>.</p><p><strong>ICS | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>This will be ICS’s first full year on the ATT&amp;CK site, and we’ll be making additions across the matrix, including more cross-domain mappings (e.g., ICS + Enterprise). We’ll be sharing more details about this and our approach to leveraging ATT&amp;CK for holistic ICS defense in an upcoming blog post.</p><p>Over the next several months, we’ll be focusing on addressing overlaps and integration with other domains (primarily between Enterprise and ICS, although Mobile could be included) and revamping ICS <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0039/">Assets</a>. This effort will focus on evaluating Assets in various industries, identifying their interrelations, and determining how they fit into the ATT&amp;CK structure.</p><p>If you’d like to share contributions or have other inputs for ICS, <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">connect with us!</a></p><p><strong>Mobile | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>We released Mobile sub-techniques last summer, and we’ll continue expanding on those, as well as building out contributions, and collaborating on enhancing multi-domain techniques. Mobile-specific Data Source objects are another goal this year, and they’ll mirror the concept of Data Source objects that <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-v10-7743870b37e3">Enterprise and ICS currently leverage</a>, informing a more detailed and defined data collection strategy. The Mobile Data Sources will eventually be featured on both the overall <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">Data Sources list</a> as well as the individual Data Source pages. For October, we plan on charting out <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">structured </a><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/">detections</a>, to enable you to enhance your Mobile detections approach.</p><p>A core focus for the domain overall is bolstering our collaboration with the mobile security community. Along with the rest of ATT&amp;CK, Mobile’s matrix is mostly crowdsourced, and we rely on the deep expertise from the mobile community to validate our content and help us to mature this knowledge base. If you’d like to contribute to this space or start a conversation, <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">reach out</a> to partner with us.</p><p><strong>Campaigns | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>We don’t typically highlight all the updates we’ll be making to ATT&amp;CK Techniques, Software, or Groups, but as the <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-campaigns-6b15baa6cbb4">newest object on the block</a>, we figured you might be curious about our plans for Campaigns this year. Over the next few months, we’ll be extracting significant Campaigns from several APT groups in ATT&amp;CK and adding them to the knowledge base. Closer to October, we’ll pivot to building out campaigns conducted by criminal groups, including ransomware operations. If you’d like to contribute or just share your thoughts on Campaigns, <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">let’s have a conversation</a>!</p><p><strong>Cloud | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>Since initially releasing ATT&amp;CK for Cloud in October 2019 (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2019/index.html">v6</a>), we have continually worked to <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-engenuity/research-partnership-matures-att-ck-for-cloud-d232998968ce">expand and refine how these platforms fit within the broader ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise</a>. Cloud introduces many new challenges for defenders, as well as potential opportunities to rethink how we describe adversary behaviors. For example, how does our understanding of tactics such as Execution, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration change when considering cloud environments?</p><p>Throughout 2023 we will work to adapt these definitions with the goal of helping everyone (cloud expert or not) better understand and utilize ATT&amp;CK for Cloud. As always, if you have specific insights or relevant ideas to share, please email us and join the #<a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035Z0AL8R0"><strong>cloud_attack</strong></a> channel on the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">ATT&amp;CK slack</a>.</p><p><strong>ATT&amp;CKcon 4.0 | October 24–25, 2023</strong></p><p>Whether you’re a sophisticated ATT&amp;CKer, a hobbyist, or you’re just getting started, we’d love to connect with you at ATT&amp;CKcon 4.0!

<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_CSbbgPWimTXkEud2wxlIA.png" /></figure><h3><strong>Introducing Campaigns to MITRE ATT&amp;CK</strong></h3><p><strong><em>By: </em></strong><em>Amy Robertson, Jared Ondricek, and Matt Malone</em></p><p>We’ve talked about building Campaigns into ATT&amp;CK in our A<a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-2022-roadmap-cd5a1a3387c7">TT&amp;CK 2022 roadmap</a>, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP0upd-65Yc&amp;list=PLkTApXQou_8Jo2B27kq62Md4bypcBqBAw&amp;index=13">ATT&amp;CKCon 3.0</a>, and most recently on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd2yLBfg8xE">SANS Threat Analysis Rundown</a> but their release is now nigh! Our initial collection of Campaigns will be available starting with our ATT&amp;CK v12 release on October 25, when you’ll be able to leverage the Campaigns structure for all of your ATT&amp;CK use cases. Prior to the release, we’re taking the opportunity to walk you through our vision for Campaigns, give you a tour of Campaigns elements, and cover our longer-term Campaigns plans.</p><p><strong>The Campaigns Vision</strong></p><p>For our purposes in ATT&amp;CK, we use “Campaigns” to describe a grouping of intrusion activity conducted over a specific period of time with common targets and objectives. A key aspect of Campaigns is that the activity may or may not be linked to a specific threat actor.</p><p>Our vision for Campaigns is to provide users with another way to view the evolution of malicious cyber operations. Threat actor activity in ATT&amp;CK currently encompasses a broad set of behaviors that can inform a holistic picture of the adversary over time. But as adversaries evolve, their TTPs often change, and by introducing some structure with Campaigns, we hope to allow you to glean more actionable intelligence and context to inform your defense prioritization<strong>. </strong>Campaigns will enable you to identify trends, track significant changes in techniques used by various actors, and monitor the introduction of new capabilities (or exploited vulnerabilities). You’ll also be able to identify continued threat actor reliance on certain techniques regardless of the campaign objective and/or targets.</p><p>Campaigns will also allow us to more accurately categorize complex intrusion activity, including those involving multiple threats (such as Ransomware-as-a-Service operations) and parse out overlapping operations that have been given the same name. With the new structure, we’ll also be converting some of the Groups in ATT&amp;CK to Campaigns. This will apply to Groups that meet our definition of a Campaign and only feature one cluster of activity (such as G0101/Frankenstein and G0014/Night Dragon).</p><p>As is our tradition of carefully integrating structural elements in ATT&amp;CK, we’ll be incorporating a limited number of Campaigns into the v12 release. This initial collection of Campaigns will feature former Group entries that are more accurately categorized as Campaigns, a curated number of Campaigns linked to existing Groups, as well as unattributed Campaigns.</p><p><strong>Campaign Elements</strong></p><p>We structured Campaigns to visually align with Groups and Software pages, and the v12 release will feature an addition of a new “Campaigns” button on the main page tool bar for easy access.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/649/1*rRkWQX7KklJV1lZ0H9pEhQ.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 1: Example of the new ATT&amp;CK tool bar with the “Campaigns” button.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Campaigns homepage will include a Campaigns table featuring ID number, Name, and activity descriptions. The list of available Campaigns in the left column highlights the Campaigns added or converted to date. As we previously covered, we created some flexibility in terms of whether or not the activity was given a unique name — a limitation we currently face with Groups — by allowing a Campaign to be simply referenced by our own identifier (e.g., C0014) if it doesn’t already come with a name.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/958/1*VpfouMBhClv5Zek8VGelyg.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 2: A draft Campaign table, with unnamed activity referenced as C0014.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each Campaign entry will feature a description of the intrusion activity, including details like known targeted countries and sectors where available, as well as any information that makes this Campaign particularly noteworthy.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4gW0dKk2KpkpJTTq2HvYtw.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 3: A draft Campaign page for all of the Trekkies out there!</em></figcaption></figure><p>Something we’ve been particularly mindful of is how to best capture the period of time related to a Campaign. We opted for the “First Seen” and “Last Seen” fields in the information box, with the corresponding reference citations, so users can see how a Campaign was scoped. For intrusion activity assessed to be ongoing at the time of report publication, we’ll add language to that affect in the Campaign description (e.g., “As of September 2022 security researchers assessed this activity was ongoing”) and update future versions of ATT&amp;CK Campaign entries accordingly.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/702/1*hFnZT2dOn2qoueCEwvBA9g.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 4: An example Campaigns information box with time frame fields and citations.</em></figcaption></figure><p>As with Groups and Software, we’ve created a “Techniques Used” table to capture actor procedure examples observed during a Campaign, with a couple of significant differences.</p><p>1. We’ll add as much detail as reporting allows regarding specific commands or steps taken by the actors, to help ATT&amp;CK users identify corresponding detection and mitigation opportunities. We’ve found this concept to be more challenging for Group and Software pages, as those tend to aggregate a variety of reporting examples over time, resulting in more generic procedure example language.</p><p>2. We’ll preface our Campaign procedure examples with the Campaign name or associated ID number, to separate it from techniques already found on a Group page. We realize the utility of this may not be immediately evident while looking at a Campaign page, but this allows for the procedure examples to stand out separately when a Campaign is associated with a Group (and, hopefully, allows for smoother integration in the future if an unattributed Campaign is later attributed to a Group).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/790/1*Od0xrpCbicBcN1AeD8S18w.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 5: Separate procedure examples as seen from a Group page, based on a fictional Campaign. The top line is the existing procedure example for T1566.001 for a Group, while the second line is specifically related to the associated Campaign.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What does this mean for Groups and Software?</strong></p><p>We’ve made two key changes to Group and Software pages as they relate to Campaigns. As previously mentioned, techniques and corresponding procedure examples mapped to a Group-attributed Campaign will carry over to the associated Group page. We’ll also continue to map Campaign-specific procedure examples to Software pages.</p><p>We’ve added a Campaigns table to associated Group and Software pages, so ATT&amp;CK users can easily reference Campaign ID numbers, Names (when applicable), and the Campaign description.</p><p>Group and Software pages will otherwise remain visually unchanged, and we’ll continue to update them separately as a collective list of all observed techniques. We want to preserve the functionality of ATT&amp;CK Navigator Layers in that respect, for ATT&amp;CK users who want to focus on all techniques used regardless of time or target.</p><p><strong>Introducing the Campaign STIX Object</strong></p><p>With the addition of Campaigns to ATT&amp;CK, the ATT&amp;CK Data Model (which can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md#the-attck-data-model">Usage document</a>), has expanded to encompass these changes. The diagram below portrays how all the moving pieces work together, with the new additions of the Campaign object type and the Relationships connected to Campaigns. It’s important to note, there are no changes to objects that previously existed in ATT&amp;CK. Software written to read earlier versions of ATT&amp;CK should continue to work, albeit missing data that only appears in Campaigns.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jVbUes3GwidA_ionbx6hbw.png" /><figcaption>Figure 6: Campaign STIX relationships</figcaption></figure><p>Now that you’ve seen our data model, we’d like to introduce you to the star of the show — the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/csprd01/part2-stix-objects/stix-v2.0-csprd01-part2-stix-objects.html#_Toc476230925">STIX Campaign object</a>. As a part of the ATT&amp;CK Data Model, it makes use of the same STIX extensions that can be found there, such as x_mitre_version. However, in addition to those previously documented fields, here is the breakdown of how ATT&amp;CK utilizes each field that is unique to the Campaign object:<br /> <br /> Standard STIX fields:</p><ul><li>type: Follows the STIX specification</li><li>name: The name used to identify the Campaign. If no name is given, then this field will contain an ATT&amp;CK identifier in the form CXXXX</li><li>description: Follows the STIX specification</li><li>aliases: Used to hold associated Campaign names</li><li>first_seen (timestamp): The time frame that this Campaign was first seen. ATT&amp;CK makes use of this field only to the level of granularity of month/year. The day and time part of this timestamp field should be ignored by parsers when displaying ATT&amp;CK Campaign information</li><li>last_seen (timestamp): The time that this Campaign was last seen or reported. ATT&amp;CK makes use of this field only to the level of granularity of month/year. The day and time part of this timestamp field should be ignored by parsers when displaying ATT&amp;CK Campaign information</li><li>objective: Not used by ATT&amp;CK</li></ul><p>Extensions of the STIX Spec:</p><ul><li>x_mitre_first_seen_citation (string): One to many citations for when the Campaign was first reported in the form “(Citation: &lt;citation name&gt;)” where &lt;citation name&gt; can be found as one of the source_name of one of the external_references.</li><li>x_mitre_last_seen_citation (string): One to many citations for when the Campaign was last reported in the form “(Citation: &lt;citation name&gt;)” where &lt;citation name&gt; can be found as one of the source_name of one of the external_references.</li></ul><p>As mentioned above, we have also added <strong>three new STIX Relationships</strong> that connect Campaigns to the rest of the ecosystem; namely that Campaigns can optionally be <strong>attributed to a Group, use Software, or use Techniques</strong>. The STIX Relationship objects themselves have no special modifications from the STIX standard and simply connect Campaigns to those previously existing objects. At a glance this seems straightforward enough, but there are some things to be aware of if you are parsing ATT&amp;CK v12 STIX going forward.</p><p>When gathering data about Groups that have Campaigns attributed to them, it’s a bit more complex to parse out all the Techniques and Software that are used by the Group. For Campaigns associated with a Group, we won’t be creating relationships between techniques and Software in that Campaign and the Group, if you would like to view the inclusive list, you’ll need to combine technique sets and Software usage.</p><p><strong>Combining Technique Sets: </strong>To get a comprehensive Group Technique view, you’ll need to combine the set of Techniques that are directly used by the Group with the set of Techniques used by all of their associated Campaigns.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/638/1*1k6NxIMlGneRco1xvLe_1w.png" /><figcaption>Figure 7: Example of Group Technique STIX inheritance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mapping Software Object Usage:</strong> To holistically map out Software object usage, you’ll identify the Groups, the Group-attributed Campaigns, and the unattributed Campaigns using the Software, and combine them for the full picture.</p><p>For further technical details on how to handle retrieving all Techniques or Software that a Group uses starting with the v12 release and how it differs from the v11 and prior releases, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md#relationships-microlibrary">Relationships Microlibrary</a> section of the <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md">GitHub Usage</a> document.</p><p><strong>What to Expect Going Forward</strong></p><p>We’ll continue modifying and building out Campaigns, with the eventual goal of revisiting a major Group pages in ATT&amp;CK and reconstructing earlier Campaigns to reflect how these actors have evolved over time. We’ll also shift focus from one-off or unattributed Campaigns to more complex Campaigns attributed to some of the more populated Group entries, such as the SolarWinds intrusion and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/">G0016/APT29</a>.</p><p>Campaigns will also serve a key role in tying together the various ATT&amp;CK matrices — Enterprise (Cloud, Containers, macOS, and Linux), Mobile, and ICS, to further document how adversaries pivot across these domains using a variety of techniques to accomplish their objectives.</p><p>We greatly appreciate the community’s feedback on Campaigns to date, and as we continue to develop Campaigns, we welcome your input. Our Contributions page will be updated in the near future to include more detailed guidance and we look forward to connecting with you via <a href="http://attack@mitre.org">email</a>, <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/mitreattack">Twitter</a>.</p><p>©2022 The MITRE Corporation.

<title>ATT&amp;CK Goes to v11</title>

<h3>ATT&amp;CK Goes to v11: Structured Detections, Beta Sub-Techniques for Mobile, and ICS Joins the Band</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JB9ySNw5GWctTPIxbjYlng.jpeg" /><figcaption>These go to eleven</figcaption></figure><p>By <a href="https://medium.com/u/37fd2c032d44">Adam Pennington</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/a4d96b83d947">Jason Ajmo</a></p><p>Right on cue, ATT&amp;CK’s latest release is out, and this time we’ve gone to v11! If you’ve been following along with our <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-2022-roadmap-cd5a1a3387c7">roadmap</a> there shouldn’t be any huge surprises in store, but we wanted to take a chance to go over our latest changes. The <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2022/">v11 set list</a> includes detections now paired with related Data Sources: Data Components, a beta version of sub-techniques for ATT&amp;CK for Mobile, ATT&amp;CK for ICS on attack.mitre.org, as well as regular updates/additions across Techniques, Software, and Groups.</p><h3>ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise Structured Detections</h3><p>Over the past few years, transforming various actionable ATT&amp;CK fields into managed objects has been a reoccurring theme. In v5 of ATT&amp;CK, we converted mitigations into objects to enhance their value and usability — with this conversion, you can now identify a <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/">mitigation</a> and pivot to various techniques it can potentially prevent. This has been a feature that many of you have leveraged to <a href="https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-control-framework-mappings">map ATT&amp;CK to different control/risk frameworks</a>. We previously converted data sources to objects for <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-v10-7743870b37e3">the v10 release</a>, enabling similar pivoting and analysis opportunities.</p><p>In today’s v11 release we’ve taken a parallel approach for detections in Enterprise ATT&amp;CK, taking the previously free text detections featured in Techniques, and have refined and merged them into descriptions that are connected to Data Sources. We have typically tried to match the detection text on a Technique to its Data Sources, but this makes the paring explicit. This will let you now see for each detection what you need to collect as inputs (Data Sources) paired with how you could analyze that data to identify a given Technique (detection). Below is an example of how Data Sources and Detections have changed for <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/">Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets (T1558)</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RNQMfeHnbQ_Hl9yY_v4E1g.png" /><figcaption>Data sources and detections in ATT&amp;CK v10 for Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets (T1558)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*L0AwG3Z0VkPk_RO6g-G1gg.png" /><figcaption>Data sources and detections in ATT&amp;CK v11 for Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets (T1558)</figcaption></figure><p>Detections will also now be included on <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">Data Source pages</a>, associated with each Technique listed for a Data Component.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p-dY4rNMtsq51NoNmZr_zQ.png" /></figure><p>As with everything else in ATT&amp;CK, these new detections also appear in our STIX as a part of the “detects” relationship added in our last ATT&amp;CK release in its “description” field. For more information about ATT&amp;CK’s STIX representation, including the data source objects and relationships added in ATT&amp;CK v10, you can check out our <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md">STIX usage document</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/793/1*j5LUee-vgAzhPIGAqP5A8g.png" /></figure><h3>Mobile Sub-Techniques Beta</h3><p>In 2020, <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-with-sub-techniques-is-now-just-attack-8fc20997d8de">we added Sub-Techniques to ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise</a>. In the time since, they’ve been well-received and solved some of the growth issues we were having in our biggest matrix. As ATT&amp;CK’s Mobile Lead Jason Ajmo <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-for-mobile-2022-roadmap-4fdb40a88a48">recently talked about</a> in the ATT&amp;CK Blog, we’re now bringing this improvement to ATT&amp;CK for Mobile as a beta release. The content on the main ATT&amp;CK site now contains the Sub-Techniques beta, and the current, stable Mobile content can be accessed at <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/matrices/mobile/">https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/matrices/mobile/</a>. We plan on making ATT&amp;CK for Mobile with Sub-Techniques final this summer, after we’ve given the community time to check out the content, get ready for it, and send us any feedback they have to <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a>. Until that time, the <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/master/mobile-attack">main STIX representation</a> of ATT&amp;CK for Mobile will remain the v10 pre-Sub-Techniques version.</p><h4>How can I move to the beta ATT&amp;CK for Mobile with sub-techniques?</h4><p>First, you’ll need to support some changes to Mobile ATT&amp;CK’s technique structure necessary to support sub-techniques. If you’re already using or have moved to versions of ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise with sub-techniques, the structural changes and the process of moving are identical. As with ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise, we’ve expanded Mobile technique IDs to identify corresponding sub-techniques: T[technique].[sub-technique]. In Mobile’s STIX representation of ATT&amp;CK we’ve added the “x_mitre_is_subtechnique = true” to “attack-pattern” objects that represent a sub-technique, and “subtechnique-of” relationships between techniques and sub-techniques. Both are already contained in our <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md">STIX documentation</a>. You can find a STIX representation of ATT&amp;CK that includes the v11 Mobile Beta <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/releases/tag/ATT%26CK-v11.0-mobile-beta">here</a>.</p><p>Next, if you want to get a head start and remap your content from a previous version of Mobile ATT&amp;CK, to this beta release. As we did when we released Sub-Techniques for ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/subtechniques/mobile-subtechniques-crosswalk.json">we’re providing a translation table or “crosswalk”</a> from previous release Mobile technique IDs to beta ones to help with the transition. The <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/subtechniques/mobile-subtechniques-crosswalk.json">JSON file</a> shows what happened to each technique in the beta release. The top-level technique ID represents each technique from the v10 release, and the structure underneath shows what changed with the v11 beta release, if anything.</p><p>Thanks to the excellent feedback from the community, we identified four key types of changes:</p><ol><li>Remains Technique</li><li>Became a Sub-Technique</li><li>One or More Techniques Became New Technique</li><li>Deprecated</li></ol><p>Each of these types of changes is represented in the “change-type” field in the JSON. Some of these changes are simpler to implement than others. We recognize this, and in the following steps, we incorporate the four types of changes into tips on how to move from our previous release to ATT&amp;CK with sub-techniques.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rwDx0DyZCuFfyC7CatO32Q.png" /></figure><h4>Step 1: Start with the easy to remap techniques first and automate</h4><p>For “Remains Technique”, “Became a Sub-Technique”, or “One or More Techniques Became New Technique” change types you can replace the previous technique ID with the new technique ID.</p><p>In some cases, technique names have changed, or tactics have been removed, so it’s also worth checking the “explanation” in the JSON.</p><p><strong>Remains Technique</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mN9-SYnxJp7bwPwRb4bSEg.png" /></figure><p>The first thing that’s easy to remap — the techniques that aren’t changing and don’t need to be remapped. Anything labeled “Remains Technique” is still a technique with an unchanged technique ID like T1398 in the above example.</p><p><strong>Became a Sub-Technique</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/785/1*U4O_kLo_D6DYrVSlaIysbA.png" /></figure><p>Next in the “easy to remap category” are the technique to sub-technique transitions, labeled “Became a Sub-Technique”. These techniques were converted into the sub-technique of another technique. In this example, Modify System Partition (T1400) became Hijack Execution Flow: System Runtime API Hijacking (T1625.001).</p><p>Finally, there are a few techniques that merged with other techniques.</p><p><strong>One or More Techniques Became New Technique</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*q0nG7sRGlRByQewj4lpBhA.png" /></figure><p>For techniques labeled “One or More Techniques Became New Technique” a new technique was created covering the scope and content of one or more previous techniques. For example, Network Traffic Capture or Redirection (T1410) and a few other techniques merged together to create Adversary-in-the-Middle (T1638).</p><p>For any of these “easy” types of changes anything represented by the previous ATT&amp;CK technique ID should be transitioned to the new technique or sub-technique ID. The ATT&amp;CK STIX objects represent this type of change as a revoked object which leaves behind a pointer to what they were revoked by. In the case of T1400, that means it was revoked by T1625.001.</p><p>In all of these cases, it’s enough to take what’s listed as the top-level key and replace it with what’s listed in the nested “id” key.</p><h4>Step 2: Look at the deprecated techniques to see what changed</h4><p>This is where some manual effort will take place. Deprecated techniques are not as straightforward.</p><p><strong>Deprecated</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/959/1*WpysMkjdhA09mrYwIEAzfA.png" /></figure><p>For techniques labeled as “Deprecated”, we removed them from ATT&amp;CK without replacing them. They were deprecated because we felt they did not fit into ATT&amp;CK or due to a lack of observed in the wild use. For example, Remotely Wipe Data Without Authorization (T1469) was removed because we hadn’t been able to find evidence of any adversary using it in the wild.</p><h4>Step 3: Review the techniques that have new sub-techniques to see if the new granularity changes how you’d map</h4><p>If you want to take full advantage of sub-techniques, there’s one more step. Many “Remains Technique” techniques now have new sub-techniques you can take advantage of.<br /> <br />One great example of an existing technique that now has new sub-techniques is Application Discovery (T1418). Its name was updated to Software Discovery, and its content was broken out into a new sub-technique: Security Software Discovery (T1418.001).</p><p>The new sub-techniques add more detail and taking advantage of them will require some manual analysis. The good news is that the additional granularity will allow you to represent different types of software discovery that can happen at a more detailed level. These types of remaps can be done over time, because if you keep something mapped to Software Discovery, then it’s still correct. You can map new stuff to the sub-techniques and come back to the old ones to make them more precise as you have time and resources.</p><p>TL;DR, if you do just Step 1 while mapping things that are deprecated to NULL, then it will still be correct. If you do Step 2, then you’ll have pretty much everything you mapped before now also mapped to the new Mobile ATT&amp;CK. If you complete Step 3, then you’ll get the newfound power of sub-techniques!</p><h3>ATT&amp;CK for ICS Joins attack.mitre.org</h3><p>ATT&amp;CK for ICS <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/launching-attack-for-ics-2be4d2fb9b8">launched at the beginning of 2020</a> on a <a href="https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Main_Page">MediaWiki site</a> similar to how attack.mitre.org used to appear. Being on a separate site has let it develop and mature independently while we’ve added it to one ATT&amp;CK resource at a time. Today <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/ics/">we’ve added ATT&amp;CK for ICS to our most visible resource, the ATT&amp;CK website</a> (attack.mitre.org).</p><p>What’s changed? First off, ATT&amp;CK for ICS will no longer have that nostalgic ATT&amp;CK Wiki look and feel, and links to ATT&amp;CK for ICS will need to be updated. Second, we’ve merged the Groups and Software from ICS, adding ICS techniques to Group and Software pages that existed on both sites, and updating descriptions to include both.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vfPGgsdQL7OofPV8jDkl6w.png" /></figure><p>Finally, we’ve merged Data Sources and Data Components in from ATT&amp;CK for ICS. Since there’s quite a bit of overlap between ICS and Enterprise Data Sources we’ve added a filter that allows you to see just Enterprise, just ICS, and all Data Sources and Components on both the overall <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">Data Sources list</a> and individual Data Source pages.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/1*vKMoYC9fQVqFbJKRcnpu_Q.png" /></figure><p>What hasn’t changed? ATT&amp;CK for ICS’s content hasn’t changed and its STIX <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/master/ics-attack">representation remains in the same place</a>. We will also be keeping the previous website in place until October 2022 to avoid breaking your deep links. We will have increasingly dire warnings on each page reminding people to update their links before it is eventually deprecated. In the future, content will only be updated on <a href="https://attack.mitre.org">attack.mitre.org</a> and not the MediaWiki site.</p><h3>What’s Left in 2022?</h3><p>We’ve just released our 2022 roadmap and continue to work across the framework. In v12 we plan on adding a new object related to groups in ATT&amp;CK, Campaigns. Check out the slides from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/MITREATTACK/attck-updates-campaigns">Matt Malone’s talk from ATT&amp;CKcon 3.0</a>, our recent <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-2022-roadmap-cd5a1a3387c7">roadmap blog post</a>, or stay tuned for more details coming soon about their implementation.</p><p>We continue our work on improving the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/macos/">macOS platform</a> and plan to focus on improvements to <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/linux/">Linux</a> between now and October.

<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RUcsdzXAWMeoDxjWmxKOqg.png" /></figure><p>With the huge rise in critical work data on smartphones over the past couple of years, mobile security is more important than ever before. With this in mind, since early 2021 we’ve been re-designing and rewriting the entirety of ATT&amp;CK for Mobile. We’ve also spent a lot of time considering how we want to continue to enhance Mobile moving forward, including increasing community understanding of the mobile threat landscape.</p><h3>ATT&amp;CK for Mobile Redux</h3><p>To start out with, we’d like to take this opportunity to (re)introduce <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/mobile/">ATT&amp;CK for Mobile</a>, by walking through why it exists, how it’s a bit different from ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise, and what’s coming in 2022.</p><p>Our ATT&amp;CK for Mobile expedition launched way back in 2016, leveraging community contributions and building on the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) publication <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/nistir/8144/draft/documents/nistir8144_draft.pdf"><em>Assessing Threats to Mobile Devices &amp; Infrastructure: The Mobile Threat Catalogue</em></a>, and the accompanying <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/mobile-threat-catalogue/">Mobile Threat Catalogue website</a>. ATT&amp;CK for Mobile was originally created to help with the NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building-blocks/mobile-device-security">Mobile Device Security project</a> and the Department of Homeland Security’s <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/st-mobile-device-security-study">Study on Mobile Device Security</a> (2017).</p><p>Mobile devices, which we currently scope to smartphones and tablets running Android, iOS, or iPadOS, are almost always powered on, ubiquitously connected to a variety of networks, contain a vast array of sensors, and run a diverse set of applications. While these properties make mobile devices incredibly useful, they also bring significant security threats.</p><p>The security architectures featured on mobile devices are based on lessons learned from the traditional PC environment, notably by providing application sandboxes and permission controls. These architectures provide significant security advantages, but threats still exist against mobile devices. The same detection and mitigation approaches used in enterprise PC environments often don’t work in the mobile environment and alternate approaches have to be leveraged. When ATT&amp;CK for Mobile was publicly released in 2017, the goal was to provide those alternate detection and mitigation approaches, and to serve as a dedicated resource to the broader mobile community.</p><h3>Matrix Structure</h3><p>Like <a href="https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Main_Page">ATT&amp;CK for ICS</a>, and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/">ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/mobile/">ATT&amp;CK for Mobile</a> is a Domain in ATT&amp;CK, with its own separate matrix and content. Despite this separation, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/mobile/">Mobile’s matrix</a> still leverages ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise’s structure, just with a distinctly Mobile flavor. ATT&amp;CK for Mobile currently features 92 techniques, each with Android and/or iOS (and iPadOS) specific descriptions, procedures, detections, and mitigations. Mobile also shares the same Software and Groups sections as ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise, but with limited overlap between the Enterprise and Mobile entries.</p><p><strong>Leveraging Mobile</strong></p><p>The Mobile matrix can be operationalized for many of the same use cases as Enterprise ATT&amp;CK. Some of the use cases we’ve seen include:</p><ul><li>Determining and prioritizing development coverage of defensive capabilities</li><li>Identifying commonalities and distinguishing characteristics in adversary tradecraft</li><li>Connecting mitigations, weaknesses, and adversaries</li><li>Determining effective security testing strategies</li><li>Evaluating mobile security products with adversary emulations</li><li>Assessing the security posture of mobile devices</li></ul><p>Additionally, with many organizations adopting ATT&amp;CK for Mobile within <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/07/bladehawk-android-espionage-kurdish/">their</a> <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/brata-keeps-sneaking-into-google-play-now-targeting-usa-and-spain/">public</a> <a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/eventbot-a-new-mobile-banking-trojan-is-born">threat</a> <a href="https://blog.cyble.com/2021/09/17/sophisticated-spyware-posing-as-a-banking-application-to-target-korean-users/">intelligence</a> <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/new-joker-variant-hits-google-play-with-an-old-trick/">reporting</a>, we’re seeing it being used more frequently as a common language to describe adversary behavior. We’re also aware of ATT&amp;CK for Mobile being used internally within vendors’ threat intelligence teams to categorize observations, as well as by vendors to map their mobile security product capabilities.</p><h3>2022 ATT&amp;CK for Mobile Roadmap</h3><p>Now that you’ve had a Mobile refresher, we’d like to highlight what’s next in 2022. We noted these in the mobile section of the <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-2022-roadmap-cd5a1a3387c7">ATT&amp;CK 2022 Roadmap</a>, but wanted to spend some more time on the details given the size of the changes coming.</p><p><strong>Sub-Techniques</strong></p><p>The mobile team has been refactoring and rewriting ATT&amp;CK for Mobile over the last several months, with the goal of content equity with Enterprise. This included the language contained within the Mobile techniques themselves, as well as mobile-specific mitigations and detections. Most significantly, we’ve also been working towards the sub-technique structure <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-subs-what-you-need-to-know-99bce414ae0b">Enterprise introduced a couple of years ago.</a></p><p>We plan on releasing a beta version of Mobile sub-techniques in April 2022 with the ATT&amp;CK v11 release. Similar to Enterprise’s sub-technique rollout, we will be providing a crosswalk from old technique IDs to new technique IDs or mapping newly broken-out sub-techniques to higher level techniques. This should minimize the overhead incurred when transitioning to the new sub-technique structure.</p><p>The sub-technique beta release will be published on a separate website alongside the main ATT&amp;CK website, clearly charting out the changes. This companion site will give the community a couple of months to preview, process, and provide feedback on the full scope of the changes before we finalize that version and make it official. Once we release the new ATT&amp;CK for Mobile framework with sub-techniques, we welcome your feedback on the good, the bad, and the needs-adjustments. When we’re finished working through the input we receive from the community, we expect to replace the current matrix with the sub-technique structure by Summer 2022.</p><p>The screenshots below show a sample parent technique and two sub-techniques: Input Capture, Keylogging (sub), and GUI Input Capture (sub).</p><figure><img alt="Input Capture ATT&amp;CK technique with sub-technique structure." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/539/1*FT5pjJAVspcnP_3nfTBTjQ.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="Input Capture Keylogging subtechnique." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/579/1*OdQBZowL5IGVnM-XfoQ4tA.png" /></figure><figure><img alt="Input Capture GUI Input Capture subtechnique." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/443/1*aAV4inQjkEApBcUmXnVLyA.png" /></figure><p><strong>Data Sources</strong></p><p>Once our sub-techniques are released, we’ll pivot to researching and drafting plans to introduce Data Source objects to Mobile, mirroring the concept of Data Source objects that <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-v10-7743870b37e3">Enterprise recently published</a>. Some examples of mobile-specific Data Sources could include:</p><ul><li>Application Binaries</li><li>Attestation APIs</li><li>Network Traffic</li></ul><p>The new metadata provided by data sources includes the concepts of <strong>relationships</strong> and <strong>data components</strong>. These concepts will more effectively represent adversary behavior from a data perspective and will provide an additional sub-layer of context to data sources. Data components narrow the identification of security events, but also create a bridge between high- and low-level concepts to inform data collection strategies. They’ll also provide a good reference point to start mapping telemetry collected in your environment to specific sub(techniques) and/or tactics. With the additional context around each data source, the results can be leveraged with more detail when defining data collection strategy for techniques and sub-techniques.</p><figure><img alt="Data Source object fields." src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/403/1*UKb95Woo7gf4FmlONcriPw.png" /></figure><p><strong>Mobile Threat Awareness Building</strong></p><p>Building on the criticality of a collective community understanding of Mobile threats, we kicked off a mini-series back in 2021 highlighting significant threats to mobile devices, starting with <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/mobile-attack-mitigating-android-abuse-50516fb7de85">abuse of Android application permissions</a>. We plan to continue the series this year, underscoring some of the key mobile threats, and how to use ATT&amp;CK for Mobile to mitigate them.</p><h3>In Closing</h3><p>Mobile’s matrix of adversary behavior has continued to grow with each new ATT&amp;CK content release, in strong part due to the contributions we receive. ATT&amp;CK for Mobile is an evolving effort and our goal is to continue to improve and mature the it. We rely on the mobile security community to share data and validate our content and look forward to collaborating with you to ensure the matrix remains beneficial.</p><p>We always welcome feedback on ATT&amp;CK for Mobile, including how you view Mobile and Enterprise security together, and where we can improve.

Nowadays, sensitive and critical data is traveling in everyday business channels that offer only the basic level of security and encryption, and companies are often oblivious to the risk. A case in point: Disney suffered a devastating data leak by a hacktivist group known as NullBulge that got hold of over 1.2 terabytes of data from Disney's internal Slack messaging channels. The breach exposed
