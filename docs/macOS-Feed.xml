<title>2023 Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities</title>
<link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-317a</link>
<guid>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-317a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>The following cybersecurity agencies coauthored this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (hereafter collectively referred to as the authoring agencies):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>United States: </strong>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Security Agency (NSA)</li>
<li><strong>Australia:</strong> Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)</li>
<li><strong>Canada: </strong>Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)</li>
<li><strong>New Zealand:</strong> New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) and Computer Emergency Response Team New Zealand (CERT NZ)</li>
<li><strong>United Kingdom:&nbsp;</strong>National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)</li>
</ul>
<p>This advisory provides details, collected and compiled by the authoring agencies, on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) routinely and frequently exploited by malicious cyber actors in 2023 and their associated Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). Malicious cyber actors exploited more zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise enterprise networks in 2023 compared to 2022, allowing them to conduct operations against high priority targets.</p>
<p>The authoring agencies strongly encourage vendors, designers, developers, and end-user organizations to&nbsp;implement the following recommendations, and those found within the <strong>Mitigations</strong> section of this advisory, to reduce the risk of compromise by malicious cyber actors.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vendors, designers, and developers</strong>. Implement <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default" title="Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software">secure by design and default principles and tactics</a> to reduce the prevalence of vulnerabilities in your software.
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow the&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-218/final"><strong>SP 800-218&nbsp;</strong></a><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-218/final" title="Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) Version 1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities">Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)</a> and implement secure by design practices into each stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC). Establish a coordinated vulnerability disclosure program that includes processes to determine root causes of discovered vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritize secure by default configurations</strong>, such as eliminating default passwords and not requiring additional configuration changes to enhance product security.</li>
<li>Ensure that published CVEs include the proper CWE field, identifying the root cause of the vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>End-user organizations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apply timely patches to systems</strong>.<br /><strong>Note:</strong> If CVEs identified in this advisory have not been patched, check for signs of compromise before patching.</li>
<li><strong>Implement a centralized patch management system.</strong></li>
<li>Use security tools such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), web application firewalls, and network protocol analyzers.</li>
<li><strong>Ask your software providers to discuss their secure by design program</strong>, provide links to information about how they are working to remove classes of vulnerabilities, and to set secure default settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Purpose</strong></h2>
<p>The authoring agencies developed this document in furtherance of their respective cybersecurity missions, including their responsibilities to develop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations.</p>

</div>
<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>
<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<p>In 2023, malicious cyber actors exploited more zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise enterprise networks compared to 2022, allowing them to conduct cyber operations against higher-priority targets. In 2023, the majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero-day, which is an increase from 2022, when less than half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero-day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting vulnerabilities within two years after public disclosure of the vulnerability. The utility of these vulnerabilities declines over time as more systems are patched or replaced. Malicious cyber actors find less utility from zero-day exploits when international cybersecurity efforts reduce the lifespan of zero-day vulnerabilities.</p>
<h4><strong>Cybersecurity Efforts to Include</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Implementing security-centered product development lifecycles. Software developers&nbsp;</strong>deploying patches to fix software vulnerabilities is often a lengthy and expensive process, particularly for zero-days. The use of more robust testing environments and implementing threat modeling throughout the product development lifecycle will likely reduce overall product vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing incentives for responsible vulnerability disclosure.&nbsp;</strong>Global efforts to reduce barriers to responsible vulnerability disclosure could restrict the utility of zero-day exploits used by malicious cyber actors. For example, instituting vulnerability reporting bug bounty programs that allow researchers to receive compensation and recognition for their contributions to vulnerability research may boost disclosures.</p>
<p><strong>Using sophisticated endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. End users&nbsp;</strong>leveraging EDR solutions may improve the detection rate of zero-day exploits. Most zero-day exploits, including at least three of the top 15 vulnerabilities from last year, have been discovered when an end user or EDR system reports suspicious activity or unusual device malfunctions.</p>

<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>
<div class="WordSection1">
<h3>Vendors and Developers</h3>
<p>The authoring agencies recommend vendors and developers take the following steps to help ensure their products are secure by design and default:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify repeatedly exploited classes of vulnerability.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perform an analysis of both CVEs and <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs)</a> to understand which classes of vulnerability are identified more than others.</li>
<li>Implement appropriate mitigations to eliminate those classes of vulnerability.</li>
<li>If a product has several instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities, ensure all database queries in the product use parameterized queries and prohibit other forms of queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure business leaders are responsible for security.
<ul>
<li>Business leaders should ensure their teams take proactive steps to eliminate entire classes of security vulnerabilities, rather than only making one-off patches when new vulnerabilities are discovered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Follow&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-218/final"><strong>SP 800-218</strong> <strong>SSDF</strong></a> and implement secure by design practices into each stage of the SDLC; in particular, aim to perform the following SSDF recommendations:
<ul>
<li>Prioritize the use of memory safe languages wherever possible [<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf">SSDF PW 6.1</a>].</li>
<li>Exercise due diligence when selecting software components (e.g., software libraries, modules, middleware, frameworks) to ensure robust security in consumer software products [<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf">SSDF PW 4.1</a>].</li>
<li>Set up secure software development team practices—this includes conducting peer code reviews, working to a common organization secure coding standard, and maintaining awareness of language-specific security concerns [<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf">SSDF PW.5.1, PW.7.1, PW.7.2</a>].</li>
<li>Establish a <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/governance-and-user-education/governance/vulnerability-disclosure-programs-explained">vulnerability disclosure program</a> to verify and resolve security vulnerabilities disclosed by people who may be internal or external to the organization [<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf">SSDF RV.1.3</a>] and establish processes to determine root causes of discovered vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Use static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) tools to analyze product source code and application behavior to detect error-prone practices [<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf">SSDF PW.7.2, PW.8.2</a>].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Configure production-ready products to have the most secure settings by default</strong> and provide guidance on the risks of changing each setting [<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218.pdf">SSDF PW.9.1, PW9.2</a>].
<ul>
<li>Prioritize secure by default configurations such as eliminating default passwords, implementing single sign on (SSO) technology via modern open standards, and providing high-quality audit logs to customers with no additional configuration necessary and at no extra charge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ensure published CVEs include the proper CWE field</strong> identifying the root cause of the vulnerability to enable industry-wide analysis of software security and design flaws.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on designing secure by design and default products, including additional recommended secure by default configurations, see CISA’s joint guide <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design-and-default">Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Security by Design and Default</a>.</p>
<h3>End-User Organizations</h3>
<p>The authoring agencies recommend end-user organizations implement the mitigations below to improve their cybersecurity posture based on threat actors’ activity. These mitigations align with the cross-sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals">CPGs webpage</a>&nbsp;for more information on CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.</p>
<h4><strong>Vulnerability and Configuration Management</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Update software, operating systems, applications, and firmware on IT network assets in a timely manner</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E">CPG 1.E</a>].
<ul>
<li>Prioritize patching <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">KEVs</a>, especially those CVEs identified in this advisory, then critical and high vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution or denial-of-service on internet-facing equipment.</li>
<li>For patch information on CVEs identified in this advisory, refer to the <strong>Appendix: Patch Information and Additional Resources for Top Exploited Vulnerabilities</strong>.
<ul>
<li>If a patch for a KEV or critical vulnerability cannot be quickly applied, implement vendor-approved workarounds.</li>
<li>Replace end-of-life software (i.e., software no longer supported by the vendor).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Routinely perform automated asset discovery</strong> across the entire estate to identify and catalogue all the systems, services, hardware, and software.</li>
<li><strong>Implement a robust patch management process&nbsp;</strong>and centralized patch management system that establishes prioritization of patch applications [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#AssetInventory1A">CPG 1.A].</a>
<ul>
<li>Organizations that are unable to perform rapid scanning and patching of internet-facing systems should consider moving these services to mature, reputable cloud service providers (CSPs) or other managed service providers (MSPs).</li>
<li>Reputable MSPs can patch applications (such as webmail, file storage, file sharing, chat, and other employee collaboration tools) for their customers.<br /><strong>Note:</strong> MSPs and CSPs can expand their customer’s attack surface and may introduce unanticipated risks, so organizations should proactively collaborate with their MSPs and CSPs to jointly reduce risk [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-performance-goals-cpgs#ThirdPartyValidationofCybersecurityControlEffectiveness1F">CPG 1.F</a>].

LightSpy for macOS was first discovered by ThreatFabric, which published a report in May 2024 in which they described their findings with the malware.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After a thorough investigation of the LightSpy client and server systems, the analysts discovered that they were using the same server to manage both the macOS and iOS versions of the program.

IPhones are undeniably more secure than Android devices, however, Google has been making constant efforts to close the gap, so Apple devices are not immune to attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The fact that Apple now regularly alerts consumers when the company detects an attack, the fact that a new cyber report just released recently warns that iPhones are under attack from hackers who are equipped with enhanced cyber tools, and the fact that "rebooting an Apple device regularly is a good practice for Apple device owners" is a better practice.

LightSpy is a program that many users are familiar with. Several security firms have reported that this spyware has already been identified on multiple occasions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The spyware attacks iOS, macOS, and Android devices at the same time. In any case, it has resurfaced in the headlines again, and ThreatFabric reports that it has been improved greatly. Among other things, the toolset has increased considerably from 12 to 28 plugins - notably, seven of these plugins are destructive, allowing them to interfere with the device's boot process adversely.

The malware is being distributed by attack chains utilizing known security flaws in Apple iOS and macOS as a means of triggering a WebKit exploit.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A file with an extension ".PNG" is dropped by this exploit, but this file, in fact, is a Mach-O binary that exploits a memory corruption flaw known as CVE-2020-3837 to retrieve next-stage payloads from a remote server.

LightSpy comes with a component called FrameworkLoader, which in turn downloads the application's main module, the Core module, and the available plugins, which have increased from 12 to 28 since LightSpy 7.9.0 was released.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Dutch security company reports that after the Core starts up, it will perform an Internet connectivity check using Baidu.com domains and, upon checking those arguments, the arguments will be compared against those passed from FrameworkLoader, which will be used to determine the [command-and-control] data and working directory," the security company stated.

This means that the Core will create subfolders for log files, databases, and exfiltrated data using the /var/containers/Bundle/AppleAppLit/working directory path.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This plugin can collect a wide range of data, including Wi-Fi information, screenshots, location, iCloud Keychain, sound recordings, photos, browser history, contacts, call history, and SMS messages. Additionally, these plugins can be used to gather information from apps such as Files, LINE, Mail Master, Telegram, Tencent QQ, WeChat, and WhatsApp as well.

In the latest version of LightSpy (7.9.0), a component called FrameworkLoader is responsible for downloading and installing LightSpy's Core module and its various plugins, which has increased in number from 12 to 28 in the most recent version.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon Core's startup, it will query the Baidu.com domain for Internet connectivity before examining the arguments provided by FrameworkLoader as the working directory and command-and-control data to determine whether it can establish Internet connectivity. In the Core, subfolders for logs, databases, and exfiltrated data are made using the working directory path /var/containers/Bundle/AppleAppLit/ as a default path.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Among the many details that the plugins can collect are information about Wi-Fi networks, screenshots, locations, iCloud Keychain, sound recordings, images, contacts, call history, and SMS messages, just to mention a few. The apps can also be configured to collect data from apps such as Files, LINE, Mail Master, Telegram, Tencent QQ, WeChat, and WhatsApp as well as from search engines. It should be noted that some of the recent additions to Google Chrome include some potentially damaging features that can erase contacts, media files, SMS messages, Wi-Fi settings profiles, and browsing history in addition to wiping contacts and media files.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, these plugins are even capable of freezing the device and preventing it from starting up again once it is frozen. It has also been discovered that some LightSpy plugins can be used to create phony push alerts with a different URL embedded within them.

Upon analyzing the C2 logs, it was found that 15 devices were infected, out of which eight were iOS devices.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Researchers suspect that most of these devices are intentionally spreading malware from China or Hong Kong, and frequently connect to a special Wi-Fi network called Haso_618_5G, which resembles a test network and seems to originate from China or Hong Kong.

It was also discovered during ThreatFabric's investigation that Light Spy contains a unique plugin for recalculating location data specific to Chinese systems, suggesting that the spyware's developers may live in China, as the information it contains appears to have been obtained from Chinese sources.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">LightSpy's operators heavily rely on "one-day exploits," and consequently they take advantage of vulnerabilities as soon as they become public information.

Using ThreatFabric's recommendation as a guide to iOS users, they are advised to reboot their iOS devices regularly since LightSpy, since it relies on a "rootless jailbreak," can not survive a reboot, giving users a simple, but effective, means to disrupt persistent spyware infections on their devices.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As the researchers say, "The LightSpy iOS case illustrates the importance of keeping system updates current," and advise users to do just that. "Terrorists behind the LightSpy attack monitor security researchers' publications closely, using exploits that have recently been reported by security researchers as a means of delivering payloads and escalating their privileges on affected devices."

Most likely, the infection takes place through the use of lures, which lead to infected websites used by the intended victim groups, i.e. so-called watering holes on the Internet.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For users concerned about potential vulnerability to such attacks, ThreatFabric advises a regular reboot if their iOS is not up-to-date.

LightSpy for macOS was first discovered by ThreatFabric, which published a report in May 2024 in which they described their findings with the malware.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After a thorough investigation of the LightSpy client and server systems, the analysts discovered that they were using the same server to manage both the macOS and iOS versions of the program.

IPhones are undeniably more secure than Android devices, however, Google has been making constant efforts to close the gap, so Apple devices are not immune to attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The fact that Apple now regularly alerts consumers when the company detects an attack, the fact that a new cyber report just released recently warns that iPhones are under attack from hackers who are equipped with enhanced cyber tools, and the fact that "rebooting an Apple device regularly is a good practice for Apple device owners" is a better practice.

LightSpy is a program that many users are familiar with. Several security firms have reported that this spyware has already been identified on multiple occasions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The spyware attacks iOS, macOS, and Android devices at the same time. In any case, it has resurfaced in the headlines again, and ThreatFabric reports that it has been improved greatly. Among other things, the toolset has increased considerably from 12 to 28 plugins - notably, seven of these plugins are destructive, allowing them to interfere with the device's boot process adversely.

The malware is being distributed by attack chains utilizing known security flaws in Apple iOS and macOS as a means of triggering a WebKit exploit.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A file with an extension ".PNG" is dropped by this exploit, but this file, in fact, is a Mach-O binary that exploits a memory corruption flaw known as CVE-2020-3837 to retrieve next-stage payloads from a remote server.

LightSpy comes with a component called FrameworkLoader, which in turn downloads the application's main module, the Core module, and the available plugins, which have increased from 12 to 28 since LightSpy 7.9.0 was released.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Dutch security company reports that after the Core starts up, it will perform an Internet connectivity check using Baidu.com domains and, upon checking those arguments, the arguments will be compared against those passed from FrameworkLoader, which will be used to determine the [command-and-control] data and working directory," the security company stated.

This means that the Core will create subfolders for log files, databases, and exfiltrated data using the /var/containers/Bundle/AppleAppLit/working directory path.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This plugin can collect a wide range of data, including Wi-Fi information, screenshots, location, iCloud Keychain, sound recordings, photos, browser history, contacts, call history, and SMS messages. Additionally, these plugins can be used to gather information from apps such as Files, LINE, Mail Master, Telegram, Tencent QQ, WeChat, and WhatsApp as well.

In the latest version of LightSpy (7.9.0), a component called FrameworkLoader is responsible for downloading and installing LightSpy's Core module and its various plugins, which has increased in number from 12 to 28 in the most recent version.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon Core's startup, it will query the Baidu.com domain for Internet connectivity before examining the arguments provided by FrameworkLoader as the working directory and command-and-control data to determine whether it can establish Internet connectivity. In the Core, subfolders for logs, databases, and exfiltrated data are made using the working directory path /var/containers/Bundle/AppleAppLit/ as a default path.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Among the many details that the plugins can collect are information about Wi-Fi networks, screenshots, locations, iCloud Keychain, sound recordings, images, contacts, call history, and SMS messages, just to mention a few. The apps can also be configured to collect data from apps such as Files, LINE, Mail Master, Telegram, Tencent QQ, WeChat, and WhatsApp as well as from search engines. It should be noted that some of the recent additions to Google Chrome include some potentially damaging features that can erase contacts, media files, SMS messages, Wi-Fi settings profiles, and browsing history in addition to wiping contacts and media files.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, these plugins are even capable of freezing the device and preventing it from starting up again once it is frozen. It has also been discovered that some LightSpy plugins can be used to create phony push alerts with a different URL embedded within them.

Upon analyzing the C2 logs, it was found that 15 devices were infected, out of which eight were iOS devices.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Researchers suspect that most of these devices are intentionally spreading malware from China or Hong Kong, and frequently connect to a special Wi-Fi network called Haso_618_5G, which resembles a test network and seems to originate from China or Hong Kong.

It was also discovered during ThreatFabric's investigation that Light Spy contains a unique plugin for recalculating location data specific to Chinese systems, suggesting that the spyware's developers may live in China, as the information it contains appears to have been obtained from Chinese sources.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">LightSpy's operators heavily rely on "one-day exploits," and consequently they take advantage of vulnerabilities as soon as they become public information.

Using ThreatFabric's recommendation as a guide to iOS users, they are advised to reboot their iOS devices regularly since LightSpy, since it relies on a "rootless jailbreak," can not survive a reboot, giving users a simple, but effective, means to disrupt persistent spyware infections on their devices.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As the researchers say, "The LightSpy iOS case illustrates the importance of keeping system updates current," and advise users to do just that. "Terrorists behind the LightSpy attack monitor security researchers' publications closely, using exploits that have recently been reported by security researchers as a means of delivering payloads and escalating their privileges on affected devices."

Most likely, the infection takes place through the use of lures, which lead to infected websites used by the intended victim groups, i.e. so-called watering holes on the Internet.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For users concerned about potential vulnerability to such attacks, ThreatFabric advises a regular reboot if their iOS is not up-to-date. Although rebooting will not prevent the spyware from re-infecting the device, it can reduce the amount of data attackers can extract. Keeping the device restarted regularly provides an additional layer of defence by temporarily disrupting spyware's ability to persistently gather sensitive information.</div>

ESET researchers have discovered CloudScout through an investigation into a couple of past breaches in Taiwan (both targeting religious institutions and government organizations), which brought them to the attention of the company.

The CloudScout application is written in .NET and was designed to offer seamless integration with MgBot, Evasive Panda's proprietary malware framework.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In a step-by-step process, MgBot feeds CloudScout previously stolen cookies, then uses the pass-the-cookie technique to use the stolen cookies to access and infiltrate data on the cloud - a method that allows hacker to hijack authenticated Web browser sessions by hijacking the cookies.

There are several names given to the "evasive Panda" group, including the "BRONZE HIGHLAND," the "Daggerfly," and the "StormBamboo" group. This group has operated at least since 2012.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The objective of Evasive Panda is to engage in cyberespionage campaigns against countries, institutions, and individuals that oppose China's interests through the preparation and dissemination of spies, such as those in the Tibetan diaspora, religious and academic groups in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and groups supporting democracy within the Chinese society. As well as being observed in certain instances, its cyberespionage activities have the tendency to extend to other countries such as Vietnam, Myanmar, and South Korea at times.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Evasive Panda has accumulated several attack vectors, which makes it an impressive attack strategy.  There have been instances in which its operators have conducted sophisticated TTPs and exploits such as supply-chain and watering-hole attacks, DNS hijacking and other forms of attack; in addition, they have used the latest CVEs that affect Microsoft Office, Confluence, and web server applications to exploit the system. 

In addition to this, the group is demonstrating to be capable of creating sophisticated malware, which is shown by its collection of multi-platform backdoors for Windows, macOS, and Android, which are all well documented.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is most commonly used on Windows by hackers, mainly MgBot (a custom malware framework built with eight plugins, detailed in our previous blog post in which we explain its features), and Nightdoor, which was developed only recently. The backdoor, described in another blog post of ours, is a sophisticated backdoor that uses a public cloud to communicate with the command and control servers.

CloudScout is designed with the internal framework allowing it to process complex tasks, such as configuring, managing, and decrypting cookies that are required to make web requests to the modules.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As part of the CommonUtilities package, CloudScout can also manage HTTP requests and cookies, which allows the tool to adapt to the varied structures of each service being targeted, making it an effective tool for aggressive monitoring. During a period, the malware would monitor directories for new configuration files, calling for new extraction cycles that would then remove any evidence of activity. This would occur regularly.

CloudScout employs a number of targeted methods that appear to have been designed for Taiwanese users, which is evident by the language preferences and region-specific configurations embedded within its modules that appear to be tailored for Taiwanese users.

As a result of our analysis, it seems that CloudScout may have additional modules targeting social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, but we are not aware of these modules in active deployments at this time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The CloudScout tool set is a .NET toolset that Evasive Panda uses to steal data stored in cloud storage services, Ho explained. Using the pass-the-cookie technique, it hijacks authenticated sessions from web browsers that have been registered using a pass-the-cookie extension to the MgBot service.

There is an alarming development in Canadian cyberspace as the Government of Canada has accused a "sophisticated state-sponsored threat actor" from China of conducting a broad, extensive reconnaissance campaign spanning several months, against a variety of domains within the country.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In a recent statement, it was revealed that a majority of the targeted organizations were Canadian government departments and agencies, including federal political parties, as well as key legislative bodies such as the House of Commons and the Senate. Additionally, Evasive Panda, an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, targeted dozens of other entities spanning democratic institutions, critical infrastructure, defence sectors, media organizations, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This broad reach underscores the serious nature of the ongoing cyber threat.

Known by various aliases such as Bronze Highland, Daggerfly, and StormBamboo, Evasive Panda has been actively engaged in cyber espionage since at least 2012.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Its primary focus has been civil society targets, especially those associated with independence movements and democratic advocacy. ESET researchers note that this APT group is particularly focused on independence movements within the Tibetan diaspora, religious and academic organizations in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and democracy supporters within China. In recent years, Evasive Panda's operations have extended internationally, reaching regions such as Vietnam, Myanmar, South Korea, and, to a lesser extent, Nigeria.

According to the researchers, Evasive Panda is known for continually evolving its cyberattack techniques.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The latest attacks have demonstrated a marked increase in sophistication, signaling the group’s commitment to refining its approach and adapting to cybersecurity defenses. This new level of sophistication adds urgency for both national and international stakeholders to heighten their defenses and remain vigilant against this persistent and increasingly advanced cyber espionage threat.</div>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YEpt4gwe_KcB6O3mGJAzLA.png" /></figure><h3><strong>V16 Brings (Re)Balance: Restructured Cloud, New Analytics, and More Cybercriminals</strong></h3><p>In v16, we’re all about balance — striking that perfect chord between familiar and pioneering to keep things real and actionable.</p><p>This update fine-tunes how we cover cloud environments, finding equilibrium between depth and practicality to ensure it remains practical for defenders. As part of our balancing act, we’re also expanding on familiar threats while introducing some fresh behaviors and groups. This release also features optimized detection engineering offerings and enhanced usability across ATT&amp;CK tools, with the goal of a <em>balanced</em> resource for everyone.</p><p>For all the details on our updates/additions across Techniques, Software, Groups and Campaigns take a look at our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2024/">release notes</a>, our <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/changes/">detailed changelog</a>, or our <a href="https://attacksite.mitre.org/changes/changelog.json">changelog.json</a>.</p><h3>Enterprise</h3><h4>Cloud Realigned</h4><p>We’ve been working to fine-tune the balance between abstraction and detail in the Cloud matrix to cover various cloud environments and threats, while staying specific enough to guide actionable defenses. v16 unveils our efforts to keep the matrix practical for defenders across diverse setups, clarify technique descriptions, and ensure that it’s intuitively navigable.</p><p>We’d like to introduce the recalibrated <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/"><strong>Cloud matrix</strong></a><strong>,</strong> now featuring four platforms (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/iaas/">Iaas</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/saas/">SaaS</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/identityprovider/">Identity Provider</a>, and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/officesuite/">Office Suite</a>) — key changes include:</p><ul><li>Broadened <strong>Identity</strong> concept to cover multiple products and services, reflecting how identity functions work similarly across cloud setups. <br /> – This includes incorporating <strong>Azure AD</strong> into <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/identityprovider/"><strong>Identity Provider</strong></a> for clearer cloud functionality distinctions.</li><li>Clarified the <strong>Google Workspace </strong>and <strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>365</strong> overlap with the new <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/officesuite/"><strong>Office Suite</strong></a> platform, as they behave nearly identically at the technique level.</li></ul><h4>Behavior Balancing Act</h4><p>We maintained our perfect balance formula (<em>Familiar + Novel = Reality</em>) with this release, expanding on existing techniques with behaviors you’ll recognize, but weren’t previously in the matrix — for example, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/004/">T1557.004: Adversary-in-the-Middle: Evil Twin</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/004/">T1213.004: Data from Information Repositories: Customer Relationship Management Software</a><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/005/">T1213:Data from Information Repositories: Messaging Applications</a>.</p><p>For the novelty factor, this release also features some intriguing new behaviors, like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496/004/">T1496.004:Resource Hijacking:Cloud Service Hijacking</a>, where adversaries can hijack compromised SaaS applications (like email and messaging services) to send spam, while also draining your resources and impacting service availability. We also added <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1666/">T1666: Modify Cloud Resource Hierarchy</a>, highlighting how IaaS hierarchies can be manipulated to evade defenses and exploit resources by creating covert subscriptions in Azure or detaching AWS accounts from their organizations.</p><p>Our<strong> Linux </strong>and<strong> macOS </strong>behavior repository also grew, with<strong> </strong>the highly demanded <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/017/">T1546.017: Event Triggered Execution: Udev Rules</a><strong>, </strong>where adversaries can persist on Linux by tweaking udev rules to run malicious code, exploiting its permissions and background capabilities. The new <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/005/">T1558.005: Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Ccache Files</a> sub reminds us how adversaries can swipe Kerberos tickets from credential cache files to access multiple services as the current user — and even indulge in a little privilege escalation or lateral movement.</p><p>For the full list of (sub) technique additions and expansions, check out the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/changes/">changelog</a>!</p><p><strong>What’s Next:</strong> We’re looking into a optimizing a couple of disparate areas — including restructuring <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/">Defense Evasion</a> for clarity and usability. One approach we’re assessing is to organize techniques based on the specific behaviors they represent: those that focus on evading detection and those aimed at circumventing specific mitigations. We’re also evaluating how to refactor metadata to only feature what’s useable and relevant. Have thoughts or would like to contribute insights to either discussion? Share them on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a> or <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">email</a>!</p><h3>Defensive Coverage</h3><h4>Detection Engineering</h4><p>Our Defensive goal for this year was to expand detections and mitigations, and help you get more actionable through detection engineering. With our optimization of our pseudocode format for analytics — reflecting real-world query language that is meant to serve as a template for your tailored queries — v16 is coming in hot with a whole host of new analytic blueprints.</p><p>In the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0002/">Execution</a>, we’ve added <strong>85 new analytics</strong>, to help you identify techniques that execute malicious code,<strong>120 new analytics</strong> under <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006/">Credential Access</a> aimed at capturing the behaviors used to steal credentials, and <strong>26 new Cloud analytics</strong> designed to highlight techniques that exploit <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/officesuite/">Microsoft 365</a> &amp;<strong> </strong><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/cloud/identityprovider/">Azure AD</a>.</p><p>As a bonus, v16 also features a <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/mitreattack-python/blob/master/examples/analytic_extractor.py">STIX analytic extraction Python script</a> that lets you quickly pull and export analytics.</p><h4>Mitigations</h4><p>On the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/enterprise/">Mitigations</a> front, we added a new mitigation: <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1060/">Out of Band Communication</a>, focused on secure, alternative communication channels — like encrypted messaging or satellite lines — to keep critical comms safe and running during incidents and bypassing any compromised network systems. We also enhanced <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1015/">Active Directory Configuration</a> with a community contribution that adds clearer examples and detailed interpretations of group policy settings. As we continue to update Mitigations, we need your insights! When you share specific use cases, clearer examples, and detailed configurations, you’re making it easier for fellow defenders to understand and implement mitigations effectively.</p><p><strong>What’s Next: </strong>We have a lot on our docket and some areas we’re still considering, including implementing STIX IDs for data components to improve clarity and tracking, developing analytics for Initial Access and Exfiltration, and Discovery, and revamping our data sources for actionability. We’ll also looking into multi-event analytics that examine how different sources, like file modifications and process creation, interact within a short time frame instead of focusing on just one collection source. We would love your insights and collaboration on these initiatives — <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">email</a> or join <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036RA0B7EX">#defensive_attack</a> to get involved!</p><h3>Cyber Threat Intelligence</h3><p>Our CTI updates also embody the <em>perfect balance formula</em>: we’re working to close the representation gaps in the cybercrime space while continuing to update state-attributed groups.</p><p>Some of the cybercriminal additions in v16 include <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1032/">G1032</a> (Inc Ransom), a group notorious for its double-extortion tactics, as well as the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1040/">G1040</a> (Play) ransomware group, that utilizes advanced encryption and targeting of high-value victims. Both groups exploit known vulnerabilities to gain initial access and steal data before deploying their ransomware. Additionally, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1037/">G1037</a> operates as an initial access broker, using phishing techniques to infiltrate networks.</p><p>On the State front, we updated <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007/">G0007</a> and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034/">G0034</a>, both linked to different units of Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), with common behaviors, such as using malicious Microsoft Office attachments in their spear-phishing emails.</p><p><strong>What’s Next:</strong> Moving forward, we intend to continue staying responsive to your contributions — highlighting groups, software, and campaigns that matter to practitioners, while also showcasing unique and exceptional tradecraft to highlight techniques.

Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the special permissions Apple gives to its proprietary apps, and here, it is the browser, as well as the ease with which an attacker can obtain the important configuration files of an app.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, what it allows a user to do is to circumvent the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) security layer on MacBooks that is designed to safeguard sensitive data from an attacker. CVE-2024-44133 has been rated as a "medium" severity vulnerability by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), meaning that it has a 5.5 severity score as per the CVSS.

According to the CVE-2024-44133 vulnerability report, attackers can bypass the user data protection methods implemented by the operating system by bypassing Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC).&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the September 16 update for Mac Studio (2022 and later), iMac (2019 and later), Mac Pro (2019 and later), Mac Mini (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2020 and later), MacBook Pro (2018 and later), and iMac Pro (2017 and later), the vulnerability, also referred to as CVE-2024-44133, had been fixed.

Please take note that this vulnerability will only impact devices that are managed by Mobile Device Management (MDM), not any other device. Typically, MDM managed devices are subject to policies and procedures set by the IT department of an organization, which is responsible for centrally managing and maintaining the devices.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Microsoft, the flaw has been named "HM Surf." By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker would be able to bypass macOS' Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) features and gain unauthorized access to a user's protected data, which they would have no control over.

There is a possibility users may discover Safari's TCC in action while browsing a website that requires access to the camera or microphone when browsing through the website.

It was noted by Apple in mid-September that a bug in macOS Sequoia 15 has been fixed by removing the vulnerable code. However, the bug does not seem to affect MDM-managed devices.

As stated in the blog post, Microsoft’s Sequoia 15 release only protects Apple’s Safari web browser when it is installed.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was also pointed out that browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox don't have the same private entitlements as Apple applications, so they cannot bypass TCC checks like Apple applications can. Therefore, once TCC checks are approved, it is up to the app to maintain access to the privacy database as long as people have approved the checks.

This vulnerability can be exploited by removing the TCC protection for the Safari browser directory and editing a configuration file in that directory. It is stated in Microsoft's response that it involves gaining access to the user's data, such as browsed pages, the camera, microphone, and location of the device, without the user's knowledge.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Users of macOS are strongly encouraged to apply these security updates as soon as possible so that their system will be protected. Using its behavior monitoring capabilities, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has detected activities associated with Adload, one of the most prevalent macOS threat families, which may be exploiting this vulnerability in some way. In addition to detecting and blocking CVE-2024-44133 exploitation, Windows Defender for Endpoint also detects and blocks anomalous modifications of the Preferences file through HM Surf or other mechanisms that potentially exploit the vulnerability.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Microsoft, it was TCC technology that first enabled them to learn how to bypass the technology when they discovered powerdir's vulnerability. Please remember that TCC, as its name implies, is a technology that prevents apps from accessing users' personal information when they are installed and that this includes services such as location services, camera and microphone devices, download directories, and others, without the user's knowledge or consent.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the world of mobile applications, the only legal way for them to gain access to these services is by approving a popup through their user interface, or if they approve per-app access via the settings in their operating system. 

This vulnerability, known as HM-Surf, may allow attackers to bypass key security features on macOS systems, which gives them a chance to gain access to sensitive data through the use of malicious code. It is possible that users who are not authorized to exploit the flaw could exploit macOS' own security functions, such as the sandboxing mechanisms and restrictions on file access.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">HM-Surf exploit is a vulnerability that allows attackers to gain enhanced privileges, which allows them to access sensitive data and files that would otherwise require a login and password.

Initial warnings were raised about this vulnerability because it played a role in adware campaigns, where malicious actors used this loophole to install unwanted software on users' devices in order to profit from the vulnerability. There are, however, a lot more dangers than just adware; though, it is only the beginning. If the same vulnerability were weaponized, then it might even be used for more serious attacks, such as data exfiltration, surveillance, or even as a gateway to further malware infiltration in the near future.

There is probably no doubt that HM-Surf's unique ability to bypass Apple's robust security architecture is one of the most troubling aspects of this malware.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Security

macOS is widely regarded as a secure platform, but the recent discovery of the HM-Surf vulnerability shows that even advanced systems are not immune to evolving cyber threats. This finding serves as a crucial reminder for users and organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and adopt proactive measures to protect their digital environments.

Microsoft's cybersecurity team uncovered HM-Surf, an exploit posing a serious risk to macOS. Their investigation revealed a program altering Google Chrome settings to grant unauthorized microphone and camera access while collecting user and device data.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">These actions suggested preparations for a second-stage payload that could further compromise the device.

The culprit was identified as the well-known macOS adware "AdLoad." This malware hijacks browser traffic, inundates users with ads, harvests data, and transforms infected devices into botnet nodes for further malicious activity. Although Microsoft's findings aligned with HM-Surf techniques, the researchers could not conclusively link AdLoad to actively exploiting the vulnerability.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, they warned that "attackers using a similar method to deploy a prevalent threat" underscored the need for enhanced protection.

The HM-Surf vulnerability illustrates the risks associated with macOS, highlighting that no operating system is invulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Exploiting such weaknesses could lead to severe consequences, including financial losses, reputational damage, and the exposure of sensitive data. The evolving nature of these threats suggests that attackers are continuously refining their methods to bypass security measures.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">To address these challenges, organizations must adopt a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. This includes regular system updates, comprehensive monitoring, and user education on safe practices. Deploying advanced threat detection and real-time monitoring can help detect and mitigate attacks before they cause significant harm. Regular security assessments can also identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

In summary, the emergence of the HM-Surf vulnerability is a stark reminder of the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity threats. For macOS users and businesses, this discovery emphasizes the need to act swiftly in strengthening defenses and protecting digital assets against evolving risks.</div>

The issue arose when Sevco researchers detected personal iOS apps showing up on corporate Mac devices. This triggered a deeper investigation into the problem, revealing a systemic issue affecting multiple upstream software vendors and customers. The bug creates two main concerns: employees’ personal data could be unintentionally accessed by their employers, and companies could face legal risks for collecting that data. &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Sevco highlighted that while employees may worry about their personal lives being exposed, companies also face potential data liability even if the access occurs unintentionally. This is especially true when personal iPhones are connected to company laptops or desktops, leading to private data becoming accessible.

Sean Wright, a cybersecurity expert, commented that the severity of the issue depends on the level of trust employees have in their employers. According to Wright, individuals who are uncomfortable with their employers having access to their personal data should avoid using personal devices for work-related tasks or connecting them to corporate systems.

Sevco’s report recommended several actions for companies and employees to mitigate this risk.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, employees should stop using the mirroring app to prevent the exposure of personal information. In addition, companies should advise their employees not to connect personal devices to work computers. Another key step involves ensuring that third-party vendors do not inadvertently gather sensitive data from work devices. The cybersecurity experts at Sevco urged companies to take these steps while awaiting an official patch from Apple to resolve the issue.

When Apple releases the patch, Sevco recommends that companies promptly apply it to halt the collection of private employee data.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, companies should purge any previously collected employee information that might have been gathered through this vulnerability. This would help eliminate liability risks and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

This report highlights the importance of maintaining clear boundaries between personal and work devices. With an increasing reliance on seamless technology, including mirroring apps, the risks associated with these tools also escalate.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While the convenience of moving between personal phones and work computers is appealing, privacy issues should not be overlooked. The Sevco report emphasizes the importance of being vigilant about security and privacy in the workplace, especially when using personal devices for professional tasks. Both employees and companies need to take proactive steps to safeguard personal information and reduce potential legal risks until a fix is made available.</div>

<title>Patch Tuesday, October 2024 Edition</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/patch-tuesday-october-2024-edition/</link>
<guid>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/patch-tuesday-october-2024-edition/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released security updates to fix at least 117 security holes in <strong>Windows</strong> computers and other software, including two vulnerabilities that are already seeing active attacks. Also, <strong>Adobe</strong> plugged 52 security holes across a range of products, and <strong>Apple</strong> has addressed a bug in its new <strong>macOS 15</strong> &#8220;<strong>Sequoia</strong>&#8221; update that broke many cybersecurity tools.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-52647" height="515" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png" width="702" /></p>
<p>One of the zero-day flaws &#8212; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-43573" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2024-43573</a> &#8212; stems from a security weakness in <strong>MSHTML</strong>, the proprietary engine of Microsoft&#8217;s <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> web browser. If that sounds familiar it&#8217;s because this is the fourth MSHTML vulnerability found to be exploited in the wild so far in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Nikolas Cemerikic</strong>, a cybersecurity engineer at <strong>Immersive Labs</strong>, said the vulnerability allows an attacker to trick users into viewing malicious web content, which could appear legitimate thanks to the way Windows handles certain web elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once a user is deceived into interacting with this content (typically through phishing attacks), the attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulate web-based services,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cemerikic noted that while Internet Explorer is being retired on many platforms, its underlying MSHTML technology remains active and vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;This creates a risk for employees using these older systems as part of their everyday work, especially if they are accessing sensitive data or performing financial transactions online,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Probably the more serious zero-day this month is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-43572" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2024-43572</a>, a code execution bug in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Management_Console" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Management Console</a>, a component of Windows that gives system administrators a way to configure and monitor the system.</p>
<p><strong>Satnam Narang</strong>, senior staff research engineer at <strong>Tenable</strong>, observed that the patch for CVE-2024-43572 arrived a few months after researchers at <strong>Elastic Security Labs</strong> disclosed an attack technique called <a href="https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/grimresource" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GrimResource</a> that leveraged an old cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability combined with a specially crafted Microsoft Saved Console (MSC) file to gain code execution privileges.<span id="more-69126"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Although Microsoft patched a different MMC vulnerability in September (CVE-2024-38259) that was neither exploited in the wild nor publicly disclosed,&#8221; Narang said. &#8220;Since the discovery of CVE-2024-43572, Microsoft now prevents untrusted MSC files from being opened on a system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft also patched <strong>Office,</strong> <strong>Azure</strong>, <strong>.NET</strong>, <strong>OpenSSH for Windows</strong>; <strong>Power BI</strong>; <strong>Windows Hyper-V</strong>; <strong>Windows Mobile Broadband</strong>, and <strong>Visual Studio</strong>. As usual, the <strong>SANS Internet Storm Center</strong> has <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20-%20October%202024/31336" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a list of all Microsoft patches released today</a>, indexed by severity and exploitability.</p>
<p>Late last month, Apple rolled out macOS 15, an operating system update called Sequoia that broke the functionality of security tools made by a number of vendors, including CrowdStrike, SentinelOne and Microsoft. On Oct. 7, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/07/apple-fixes-bugs-in-macos-sequoia-that-broke-some-cybersecurity-tools/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apple pushed an update to Sequoia users</a> that addresses these compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Finally, Adobe has released security updates to plug a total of 52 vulnerabilities in a range of software, including <strong>Adobe Substance 3D Painter</strong>, <strong>Commerce</strong>, <strong>Dimension</strong>, <strong>Animate</strong>, <strong>Lightroom</strong>, <strong>InCopy</strong>, <strong>InDesign</strong>, <strong>Substance 3D Stager</strong>, and <strong>Adobe FrameMaker</strong>.</p>
<p>Please consider backing up important data before applying any updates. Zero-days aside, there&#8217;s generally little harm in waiting a few days to apply any pending patches, because not infrequently a security update introduces stability or compatibility issues. <strong>AskWoody.com</strong> usually has the skinny on any problematic patches.</p>
<p>And as always, if you run into any glitches after installing patches, leave a note in the comments; chances are someone else is stuck with the same issue and may have even found a solution.</p>

Security researcher Johann Rehberger demonstrated this issue through a concept he named “SpAIware,” which exploited a weakness in ChatGPT’s macOS app, allowing it to act as spyware.

ChatGPT initially only stored memory within an active conversation session, resetting once the chat ended. This limited the potential for hackers to exploit data, as the information wasn’t saved long-term.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, earlier this year, OpenAI introduced a new feature allowing ChatGPT to retain memory between different conversations. This update, meant to personalize the user experience, also created an unexpected opportunity for cybercriminals to manipulate the chatbot’s memory retention.

Rehberger identified that through prompt injection, hackers could insert malicious commands into ChatGPT’s memory. This allowed the chatbot to continuously send a user’s conversation history to a remote server, even across different sessions.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once a hacker successfully inserted this prompt into ChatGPT’s long-term memory, the user’s data would be collected each time they interacted with the AI tool. This makes the attack particularly dangerous, as most users wouldn’t notice anything suspicious while their information is being stolen in the background.

What makes this attack even more alarming is that the hacker doesn’t require direct access to a user’s device to initiate the injection. The payload could be embedded within a website or image, and all it would take is for the user to interact with this media and prompt ChatGPT to engage with it.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For instance, if a user asked ChatGPT to scan a malicious website, the hidden command would be stored in ChatGPT’s memory, enabling the hacker to exfiltrate data whenever the AI was used in the future.

Interestingly, this exploit appears to be limited to the macOS app, and it doesn’t work on ChatGPT’s web version. When Rehberger first reported his discovery, OpenAI dismissed the issue as a “safety” concern rather than a security threat. However, once he built a proof-of-concept demonstrating the vulnerability, OpenAI took action, issuing a partial fix. This update prevents ChatGPT from sending data to remote servers, which mitigates some of the risks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, the bot still accepts prompts from untrusted sources, meaning hackers can still manipulate the AI’s long-term memory.

The implications of this exploit are significant, especially for users who rely on ChatGPT for handling sensitive data or important business tasks. It’s crucial that users remain vigilant and cautious, as these prompt injections could lead to severe privacy breaches. For example, any saved conversations containing confidential information could be accessed by cybercriminals, potentially resulting in financial loss, identity theft, or data leaks.

To protect against such vulnerabilities, users should regularly review ChatGPT’s memory settings, checking for any unfamiliar entries or prompts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As demonstrated in Rehberger’s video, users can manually delete suspicious entries, ensuring that the AI’s long-term memory doesn’t retain harmful data. Additionally, it’s essential to be cautious about the sources from which they ask ChatGPT to retrieve information, avoiding untrusted websites or files that could contain hidden commands.

While OpenAI is expected to continue addressing these security issues, this incident serves as a reminder that even advanced AI tools like ChatGPT are not immune to cyber threats. As AI technology continues to evolve, so do the tactics used by hackers to exploit these systems. Staying informed, vigilant, and cautious while using AI tools is key to minimizing potential risks.</div>

The researchers add that some of the indicators pointing to AI-generated malicious code include the framework of the scripts, the comments that explain each line, and the use of native language for function names and variables.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">AsyncRAT, an open-source, publicly available malware that can record keystrokes on the victim device and establish an encrypted connection for remote monitoring and control, is later downloaded and executed by the attacker. The malware can also deliver additional payloads.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The HP Wolf Security research also states that, in terms of visibility, archives were the most popular delivery option in the first half of the year.

Using techniques such as spear-phishing, malvertising, and brand impersonation, the group spreads over 50 malware payloads, including AMOS, Stealc, and Rhadamanthys, across different sectors like gaming, cryptocurrency, and software.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, Marko Polo’s campaigns have compromised thousands of devices globally, posing a significant threat to consumer privacy and business security, with potential financial losses in the millions. The group primarily uses spear-phishing tactics via direct messages on social media, targeting high-value individuals like cryptocurrency influencers, gamers, and software developers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They impersonate popular brands such as Fortnite, Zoom, and RuneScape, creating fake job offers and project collaborations to deceive victims into downloading malware. In addition to these impersonations, Marko Polo even fabricates its own brand names like VDeck, Wasper, and SpectraRoom to lure unsuspecting users. The Marko Polo operation is highly versatile, capable of infecting both Windows and macOS platforms. On Windows, they use a tool called “HijackLoader” to deliver malware like Stealc, designed to extract data from browsers, and Rhadamanthys, which targets a wide array of applications and data types.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Rhadamanthys has also added advanced features, such as a cryptocurrency clipper to redirect payments to the attackers’ wallets, and the ability to evade Windows Defender.

When it comes to macOS, the group deploys Atomic (AMOS), an infostealer launched in 2023, which they rent out to cybercriminals for $1,000 per month. AMOS is highly effective at extracting sensitive data stored on macOS systems, such as Apple Keychain passwords, MetaMask seeds, WiFi credentials, credit card details, and other encrypted information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Marko Polo campaign’s widespread nature highlights the dangers of information-stealing malware, and users need to be vigilant against unsolicited links and downloads from unknown sources. One of the most effective ways to protect against such malware is to download software exclusively from official websites and ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date. This ensures the detection of malicious payloads before they can compromise your system.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Information-stealing malware campaigns are becoming increasingly common, with Marko Polo’s operation serving as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics cybercriminals employ today. These stolen credentials often enable hackers to breach corporate networks, engage in data theft, and disrupt business operations. Therefore, cybersecurity awareness and strong preventive measures are crucial for protecting against such malicious activities.

This is achieved by rerouting your data through an encrypted tunnel to one of the VPN’s servers.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While the technical details can be complex, using a VPN is straightforward: you select a server location and click connect. NymVPN distinguishes itself from other VPN services by offering users a choice on how their traffic is rerouted.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Fast mode is designed for everyday online activities like messaging, casual browsing, and streaming. As suggested by its name, this mode prioritizes speed by rerouting traffic through a fully decentralized network utilizing two-hop servers. With upcoming support for WireGuard, users can anticipate even faster connections.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Anonymous mode is tailored for highly sensitive activities and is what sets NymVPN apart from competitors. In this mode, traffic is routed through five different servers and supplemented with "network noise," making it exceptionally challenging for any third party to intercept the data.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">NymVPN’s mix network is inspired by the concept of mix networks introduced by cryptographer David Chaum in the 1980s. The Mixnet approach, independently developed by Chelsea Manning while incarcerated for leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks, employs several strategies to confound data surveillance efforts, including data fragmentation, dummy data packets, timing delays, and data packet shuffling.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">“With advancements in AI-driven data analytics, data surveillance capabilities are growing stronger. There’s a need for advanced decentralized networks that can thwart these tracking attempts, not just now but in the future,” explains the provider in a <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nymvpn-free-beta-testing">blog post.</a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">NymVPN uses a mix network to disrupt data surveillance by employing techniques such as fragmenting data, adding dummy data packets, introducing timing delays, and shuffling data packets.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When the NymVPN was first launched in its Alpha phase in November, Halpin explained: “AI models are effective at analyzing data by identifying patterns. Our VPN counters this by adding fake traffic, mixing traffic, and scrambling the patterns. In essence, while our service functions like a VPN, it’s essentially an anti-artificial intelligence machine.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>How to Use NymVPN Beta</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The NymVPN team is now inviting users to explore the VPN in its beta phase, test its features, and provide feedback.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">To start using NymVPN, visit nymvpn.com and enter your email address. You’ll receive a confirmation email shortly; verify your subscription through the link provided.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While you wait, you can download the NymVPN app on your preferred device. The service offers applications for all major operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once you have installed the app, you’ll receive an anonymous credential, which you can enter under the "Add Your Credential" section in the NymVPN app's settings. You’re all set to explore and determine if this is truly the most private VPN available.</div>

<title>#StopRansomware: RansomHub Ransomware</title>
<link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-242a</link>
<guid>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-242a</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware" title="#StopRansomware"><em>stopransomware.gov</em></a><em> to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources.</em></p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations)&nbsp;are releasing this joint advisory to disseminate known RansomHub ransomware IOCs and TTPs. These have been identified through FBI threat response activities and third-party reporting as recently as August 2024. RansomHub is a ransomware-as-a-service variant—formerly known as Cyclops and Knight—that has established itself as an efficient and successful service model (recently attracting high-profile affiliates from other prominent variants such as LockBit and ALPHV).</p>
<p>Since its inception in February 2024, RansomHub has encrypted and exfiltrated data from at least 210 victims representing the water and wastewater, information technology, government services and facilities, healthcare and public health, emergency services, food and agriculture, financial services, commercial facilities, critical manufacturing, transportation, and communications critical infrastructure sectors.</p>
<p>The affiliates leverage a double-extortion model by encrypting systems and exfiltrating&nbsp;data to extort victims. It should be noted that data exfiltration methods are dependent on the affiliate conducting the network compromise. The ransom note dropped during encryption does not generally include an initial ransom demand or payment instructions. Instead, the note provides victims with a client ID and instructs them to contact the ransomware group via a unique <code>.onion</code> URL (reachable through the Tor browser). The ransom note typically gives victims between three and 90 days to pay the ransom (depending on the affiliate) before the ransomware group publishes their data on the RansomHub Tor data leak site.</p>
<p>The authoring organizations encourage network defenders to implement the recommendations in the&nbsp;<strong>Mitigations</strong> section of this cybersecurity advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents.</p>

<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This advisory uses the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/matrices/enterprise/" title="Enterprise Matrix">MITRE ATT&amp;CK<sup>®</sup> Matrix for Enterprise</a> framework, version 15. See the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.</p>
<h3>Initial Access</h3>
<p>RansomHub affiliates typically compromise internet facing systems and user endpoints by using methods such as phishing emails [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1566/" title="Phishing">T1566</a>], exploitation of known vulnerabilities [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1190/" title="Exploit Public-Facing Application">T1190</a>], and password spraying [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1110/003/" title="Brute Force: Password Spraying">T1110.003</a>]. Password spraying targets accounts compromised through data breaches. Proof-of-concept exploits are obtained from sources such as ExploitDB and GitHub [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1588/005/" title="Obtain Capabilities: Exploits">T1588.005</a>]. Exploits based on the following CVEs have been observed:</p>

<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>RansomHub affiliates conduct network scanning with tools such as AngryIPScanner, Nmap, and PowerShell-based living off the land methods with PowerShell to conduct network scanning [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1018/" title="Remote System Discovery">T1018</a>][<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1046/" title="Network Service Discovery">T1046</a>][<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1059/001/" title="Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell">T1059.001</a>].</p>
<h3>Defense Evasion</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity researchers have observed affiliates renaming the ransomware executable with innocuous file names, such as <code>Windows.exe</code>, left on the user’s desktop (<code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop</code>) or downloads (<code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads</code>) [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1036/" title="Masquerading">T1036</a>]. The affiliates have also cleared Windows and Linux system logs to inhibit any potential incident response [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1070/" title="Indicator Removal">T1070</a>]. Affiliates used Windows Management Instrumentation [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1047/" title="Windows Management Instrumentation">T1047</a>] to disable antivirus products. In some instances, RansomHub-specific tools were deployed to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) tooling [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1562/001/" title="Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools">T1562.001</a>].</p>
<h3>Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement</h3>
<p>Following initial access, RansomHub affiliates created user accounts for persistence [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1136/" title="Create Account">T1136</a>], reenabled disabled accounts [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1098/" title="Account Manipulation">T1098</a>], and used Mimikatz [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0002/" title="Mimikatz">S0002</a>] on Windows systems to gather credentials [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1003/" title="OS Credential Dumping">T1003</a>] and escalate privileges to SYSTEM [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1068/" title="Exploitation for Privilege Escalation">T1068</a>]. Affiliates then moved laterally inside the network through methods including Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1021/001/" title="Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol">T1021.001</a>], PsExec [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0029/" title="PsExec">S0029</a>], Anydesk [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1219/" title="Remote Access Software">T1219</a>], Connectwise, N-Able, Cobalt Strike [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0154/" title="Cobalt Strike">S0154</a>], Metasploit, or other widely used command-and-control (C2) methods.</p>
<h3>Data Exfiltration</h3>
<p>Data exfiltration methods depend heavily on the affiliate conducting the network compromise. The ransomware binary does not normally include any mechanism for data exfiltration. Data exfiltration has been observed through the usage of tools such as PuTTY [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1048/002/" title="Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol">T1048.002</a>], Amazon AWS S3 buckets/tools [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1537/" title="Transfer Data to Cloud Account">T1537</a>], HTTP POST requests [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1048/003/" title="Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol">T1048.003</a>], WinSCP, Rclone, Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, and other methods.</p>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>RansomHub ransomware has typically leveraged an Elliptic Curve Encryption algorithm called Curve 25519 to encrypt user accessible files on the system [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1486/" title="Data Encrypted for Impact">T1486</a>]. Curve 25519 uses a public/private key that is unique to each victim organization. To successfully encrypt files that are currently in use, the ransomware binary will typically attempt to stop the following processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>"vmms.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"msaccess.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"mspub.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"svchost.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"vmcompute.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"notepad.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"ocautoupds.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"ocomm.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"ocssd.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"oracle.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"onenote.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"outlook.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"powerpnt.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"explorer.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"sql.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"steam.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"synctime.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"vmwp.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"thebat.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"thunderbird.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"visio.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"winword.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"wordpad.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"xfssvccon.exe"</em></li>
<li><em>"TeamViewer.exe"</em></li>

<p>The ransomware binary will attempt to encrypt any files that the user has access to, including user files and networked shares.</p>
<p>RansomHub implements intermittent encryption, encrypting files in 0x100000 byte chunks and skipping every 0x200000 bytes of data in between encrypted chunks. Files smaller than 0x100000 bytes in size are completely encrypted. Files are appended with 58 (0x3A) bytes of data at the end. This data contains a value which is likely part of an encryption/decryption key. The structure of the appended 0x3A bytes is listed below with images from three different encrypted files.</p>

<p>The next eight bytes are the size of encrypted blocks. If the entire file is encrypted, this section is all zeros. In this example, each encrypted section is 0x100000 bytes long, with 0x100000 bytes between each encrypted block. This number was observed changing based on the size of the encrypted file.</p>

<p>The ransomware executable does not typically encrypt executable files.&nbsp;A random file extension is added to file names and a ransom note generally titled <code>How To Restore Your Files.txt</code> is left on the compromised system. To further inhibit system recovery, the ransomware executable typically leverages the <code>vssadmin.exe</code> program to delete volume shadow copies [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1490/" title="Inhibit System Recovery">T1490</a>].</p>

<h2><strong>Incident Response</strong></h2>
<p>If compromise is detected, organizations should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quarantine or take potentially affected hosts offline.</li>
<li>Reimage compromised hosts.</li>
<li>Provision new account credentials.</li>
<li>Collect and review artifacts such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.</li>
<li>Report the compromise to CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (<a href="mailto:report@cisa.gov" title="Report to CISA">report@cisa.gov</a> or 888-282-0870). State, local, tribal, or territorial government entities can also report to the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) (<a href="mailto:SOC@cisecurity.org" title="Report to MS-ISAC">SOC@cisecurity.org</a> or 866-787-4722).</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>
<h3>Network Defenders</h3>
<p>The authoring organizations recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve cybersecurity posture based on RansomHub’s activity. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals" title="Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals">Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals</a> for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Require all accounts with password logins</strong> <strong>(e.g., service accounts, admin accounts, and domain admin accounts) to comply with&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/" title="Digital Identity Guidelines">National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards</a><strong> for developing and managing password policies.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 characters in length;</li>
<li>Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers;</li>
<li>Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials;</li>
<li>Avoid reusing passwords;</li>
<li>Implement multiple failed login attempt account lockouts;</li>
<li>Disable password “hints”; and</li>
<li>Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year.<br /><strong>Note:</strong> NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher.</li>
<li>Require administrator credentials to install software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware up to date</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E)" title="Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities (1.E)">CPG 1.E</a>]. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Prioritize patching known exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems.</li>
<li><strong>Require Phishing-Resistant multifactor authentication to administrator accounts</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#PhishingResistantMultifactorAuthenticationMFA2H" title="Phishing-Resistant Multifactor Authentication (MFA) (2.H)">CPG 2.H</a>] and require standard MFA for all services to the extent possible (particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical systems).</li>
<li><strong>Segment networks</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#NetworkSegmentation2F" title="Network Segmentation (2.F)">CPG 2.F</a>] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.</li>
<li><strong>Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A" title="Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)">CPG 3.A</a>]. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon network connections for each host.</li>
<li><strong>Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus</strong> <strong>software on all hosts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Implement Secure Logging Collection and Storage Practices&nbsp;</strong>[<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#LogCollection2T" title="Log Collection (2.T)">CPG 2.T</a>].<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Learn more about logging best practices by referencing <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/logging-made-easy" title="Logging Made Easy">CISA’s Logging Made Easy</a> resources.</li>
<li><strong>Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories</strong> for new and/or unrecognized accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Audit user accounts</strong> with administrative privileges and configure access controls according to the principle of least privilege.</li>
<li><strong>Disable unused ports.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Implement and enforce email security policies</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#EmailSecurity2M" title="Email Security (2.M)">CPG 2.M</a>].</li>
<li><strong>Disable macros by default</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DisableMacrosbyDefault2N" title="Disable Macros by Default (2.N)">CPG 2.N</a>].</li>
<li><strong>Consider adding an email banner to emails</strong> received from outside your organization.</li>
<li><strong>Disable hyperlinks in received emails.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher.</strong> For example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain task.</li>
<li><strong>Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions.</strong> Privilege escalation and lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration</strong> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E" title="System Backups (2.R)">CPG 2.R</a>]. By instituting this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have irretrievable data.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure all backup data is encrypted,</strong> immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers the entire organization’s data infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The above mitigations apply to enterprises and critical infrastructure organizations with on-premises or hybrid environments. Recognizing that insecure software is the root cause of many of these flaws and that the responsibility should not be on the end user, CISA urges software manufacturers to implement the following to reduce the prevalence of identified or exploited issues (e.g., misconfigurations, weak passwords, and other weaknesses identified and exploited through the assessment team):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Embed security into product architecture</strong> throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).</li>
<li><strong>Mandate MFA, ideally phishing-resistant MFA, for privileged users</strong> and make MFA a default, rather than opt-in, feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>These mitigations align with tactics provided in the joint guide <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design" title="Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software">Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software</a>. CISA urges software manufacturers to take ownership of improving the security outcomes of their customers by applying these and other secure by design tactics. By using secure by design tactics, software manufacturers can make their product lines secure “out of the box” without requiring customers to spend additional resources making configuration changes, purchasing security software and logs, monitoring, and making routine updates.</p>
<p>For more information on secure by design, see CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign" title="Secure by Design">Secure by Design</a> webpage.</p>
<h2><strong>Validate Security Controls</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your organization’s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring organizations recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&amp;CK techniques described in this advisory.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select an ATT&amp;CK technique described in this advisory (see<strong>&nbsp;Table 6–Table 17</strong>).</li>
<li>Align your security technologies against the technique.</li>
<li>Test your technologies against the technique.</li>
<li>Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance.</li>
<li>Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.</li>
<li>Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.</li>
</ol>
<p>CISA, FBI, MS-ISAC, and HHS recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques identified in this advisory.</p>

<h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2>
<p>Your organization has no obligation to respond or provide information to the FBI in response to this joint advisory. If, after reviewing the information provided, your organization decides to provide information to the FBI, reporting must be consistent with applicable state and federal laws.</p>
<p>The FBI is interested in any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.</p>
<p>Additional details of interest include a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host- and network-based indicators.</p>
<p>The authoring organizations do not encourage paying a ransom, as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI’s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice" title="Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3)">Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3)</a>, a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices" title="Field Offices">local FBI Field Office</a>, or CISA via the agency’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/report" title="Report to CISA">Incident Reporting System</a> or its 24/7 Operations Center (<a href="mailto:report@cisa.gov)" title="Report to CISA">report@cisa.gov</a>) or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).</p>

It underscores how threat actors are increasingly targeting the OS as a target.

As of late 2023, malware dubbed Cthulhu Stealer was available as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) product and was priced at $500 per month as part of a subscription-based price structure.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As far as the architecture is concerned, it can support both x86_64 and Arm platforms. 

Several cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new form of macOS malware that can steal user's sensitive data in the most insidious ways. A malware called Cthulhu Stealer has been spotted that impersonates popular applications to infect users with Trojan malware that allows the malware to steal passwords for users' operating systems and the iCloud keychain, as well as cryptocurrency wallets.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A $500/month service offering for bad actors has reportedly been available since late 2023, as part of the Cthulhu Stealer program. It is particularly effective because it can masquerade as legitimate software and thus make itself appear more appealing.

A Cado Security researcher has pointed out that Cthulhu Stealer is an Apple disk image (DMG) that carries two binaries, depending on the architecture of the machine, according to Gould.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Using Golang, the malware disguises itself as a legitimate piece of software and disguises itself as a malicious application.

A few of the software programs it impersonates include CleanMyMac, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Adobe GenP because the last of these is an open-source tool that can patch Adobe apps to bypass Creative Cloud service encryption and use the serial key to activate them without having to create a login account with a creator's account.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A user who launches an unsigned file that has been explicitly allowed to be run – i.e., bypassing Gatekeeper protections – will be prompted to enter their system password when they launch it. In addition to Atomic Stealer, Cuckoo, MacStealer, and Banshee Stealer using this postscript-based approach, other software developers have adopted similar approaches.

Afterwards, a second prompt will appear asking the user to enter their MetaMask password for the third time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This tool was also designed with the goal of harvesting system information and dumping iCloud Keychain passwords using an open-source tool called Chain Breaker which an anonymous developer developed.

There are several ways the data theft takes place, including through the use of web browser cookies and information from Telegram accounts. This information is compressed and stored in a ZIP file, before being sent to a command-and-control server (C2).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is believed that the main purpose of Cthulhu Stealer is to steal credentials and cryptocurrency wallets from a wide range of shops and services, including game accounts, to steal information.

The functionality and features of Cthulhu Stealer are very similar to that of Atomic Stealer, which implies that it was probably developed by the same person who modified Atomic Stealer. As users can see from the above paragraph, Atomic Stealer and Cthulhu both use Osascript as a password prompt. Even the spelling mistakes in the two games are identical.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result, the threat actors responsible for the malware appear to have vanished, in part due to disagreements over payments, which has led to affiliates accusing the main developer of an exit scam, which has led to him being permanently banned from the cybercrime marketplace he used to advertise the malware in the first place.

It is important to note that Cthulhu Stealer does not have very sophisticated anti-analysis techniques that would allow it to operate stealthily, which could be used to avoid detection.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As well as this, it does not include any features that set it apart from similar underground offerings, apart from the fortress is one issue that affects this.

Malware like Cthulhu Stealer, as well as other software threats like it, can cause far less damage when users take macOS' security features seriously, so they do not fall victim to them.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">MacOS is much less commonly targeted by malware threats than Windows or Linux, but users are advised to stay away from downloading software from sources they don't trust, stay away from installing apps that are not verified, and make sure their systems are updated with the latest security measures.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There has been a surge in macOS malware recently and in response Apple announced this week that an update is coming to its next version of the operating system that will add more friction when trying to open software that is not signed correctly or notarized, which will help prevent future outbreaks of macOS malware.</div>

<title>Introducing TAXII 2.1 and a fond farewell to the TAXII 2.0 Server</title>
<link>https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-taxii-2-1-and-a-fond-farewell-to-taxii-2-0-d9fca6ce4c58?source=rss----6da19bd08fba---4</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0GQBfYbb0frVtyhYLi3yiA.png" /></figure><p>As mentioned in our <a href="/mitre-attack/attack-2024-roadmap-8dfc46d1ad1b">2024 Roadmap</a> and the <a href="/mitre-attack/attack-v15-26685f300acc">v15 release blog</a>, we’re excited to introduce our new TAXII server and the latest addition to the ATT&amp;CK Workbench software suite: the <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 Server</a>. We’ve open-sourced the TAXII 2.1 code on <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub</a>, allowing you to set up your own servers within your organization <em>and </em>contribute to its improvement.</p><p>While you’re diving into the new 2.1 server, don’t forget: our TAXII 2.0 server is retiring on <strong>December 18.</strong></p><p><strong>To continue receiving updated ATT&amp;CK data, you’ll need to migrate from cti-taxii.mitre.org to attack-taxii.mitre.org. However, this migration may involve more than just a URL change. Given the transition from STIX 2.0 to STIX 2.1, the complexity of your migration will depend on how deeply your applications are integrated with STIX 2.0. We recommend assessing the impact on your systems and planning your migration accordingly.</strong></p><p><strong>Getting Started with TAXII 2.1</strong></p><p>Ready to explore the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 server?</p><ul><li>Visit our <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub repository</a> for the source code and detailed <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md">usage documentation</a>.</li><li>Leverage the <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-deployment">ATT&amp;CK Workbench Deployment</a> repository with <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-deployment/blob/main/compose.yaml">Docker Compose templates</a> to simplify setting up Workbench services and the TAXII 2.1 module (so you can pull the Docker images from GitHub and get started without building from source!).</li><li>Skip the source code and pull the TAXII 2.1 Docker image directly from the <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/pkgs/container/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub Container Registry</a>.</li><li>Access the server <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api-docs/">Swagger interface</a> and <a href="https://www.usebruno.com/">Bruno API Client</a> definitions (Bruno, similar to Postman, provides an easy way to interact with REST APIs). You can find our <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/tree/main/bruno">Bruno files here</a>.</li><li>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107514">OASIS TAXII 2.1 specification</a> to enhance your integration prowess.</li><li>Experience issues? Submit <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server/issues/new/choose">specific requests or encounter issues</a> on GitHub.</li></ul><p><strong>Why TAXII 2.1?</strong></p><p>We know the ATT&amp;CK community has relied on our public TAXII 2.0 server, but it had issues like frequent outages. The TAXII 2.1 server addresses these problems with a more reliable and smooth experience. It’s built for scalability and stress-tested with real-world benchmarks from TAXII 2.0, ensuring you’re less likely to face major outages. Additionally, the new server introduces pagination, which was missing in TAXII 2.0. This means you can fetch smaller chunks of data instead of the entire ~20 MB STIX collection, speeding up the process and reducing data transfer costs.</p><p>A critical update to note is that our TAXII 2.1 server will exclusively host STIX 2.1 content moving forward. This change is part of our long-term strategy to shift away from STIX 2.0, aligning with the latest standards.</p><p>The new TAXII 2.1 server is also more powerful and capable than the previous version. We designed it to smoothly integrate with Workbench, making CTI management as seamless as possible. If you’re already using the ATT&amp;CK Workbench in your CTI workflows, you can easily edit and maintain CTI data without needing additional tools. The TAXII 2.1 server integrates with the ATT&amp;CK Workbench software suite, and can automatically synch with the Workbench REST API (the Workbench “back end”).</p><p>Workbench users can add objects, STIX collections, and bundles, and the TAXII 2.1 server will automatically make them available via its REST API. You don’t need to change your editor workflows — just bring the TAXII 2.1 server online in your Workbench container stack, and it will sync every 30 minutes by default (administrators can adjust this if needed). TAXII 2.1 is also optional, and you can continue using Workbench as usual without it.</p><p>Of note, the TAXII 2.1 specification outlines two “sharing models” for TAXII server implementations:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Collection model</strong>, where the TAXII server allows producers to host a set of CTI data that can be requested by consumers: TAXII Clients and Servers exchange information in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response">request-response model</a>.</li><li>The <strong>Channel model</strong>, where the TAXII server uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe pattern</a> to allow producers to push data to many consumers and consumers to receive data from many producers.</li></ul><p>Given that Channels are still loosely defined in the TAXII specification, we decided to only implement the Collections model outlined in the TAXII 2.1 specification. However, we are open to adding support for a pub-sub model in future releases.</p><p><strong>A Brief Guide to Accessing Threat Intelligence Data</strong></p><p>With the new TAXII 2.1 server, you can still access your cyber threat intel in STIX format through the publicly accessible REST API, just like its <a href="http://cti-taxii.mitre.org/">predecessor</a> (cti-taxii.mitre.org) that’s been around for <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/att-ck-content-available-in-stix-2-0-via-public-taxii-2-0-server-317e5c41e214">over 6 years</a>. Even though this server has some sophisticated functionality, querying it is actually pretty simple. This following guide will show you the basics and help you easily get the threat intelligence data you need.</p><p>With TAXII 2.1 running on a RESTful API model and using standard HTTP requests, you can connect to the server using any HTTP client you like. This includes popular tools like curl, wget, httpie, or Postman. This flexibility allows you to seamlessly integrate TAXII 2.1 queries into your existing workflows and tools.</p><p>Let’s dive into how to structure these requests and interpret the responses.</p><p>Importantly, all TAXII 2.1 requests require a special Accept header:</p><pre>GET /taxii2/ HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1 Host: attack-taxii.mitre.org</pre><p>Here is an example of setting the Accept header using the curl tool:</p><pre>curl --request GET \<br />  --url https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/taxii2/ \<br />  --header ‘Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1’</pre><p>The request above sends a request to the TAXII server’s <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107497">Discovery endpoint</a>, which returns a list of available API roots that the TAXII server offers. Each API Root is the “root” URL of that particular instance of the TAXII API. Our TAXII server only hosts one API Root, which we can see clearly from the response body:</p><pre>{ <br />  &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MITRE ATT&amp;CK TAXII 2.1&quot;, <br />  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;This API Root contains TAXII 2.1 REST API endpoints that serve MITRE ATT&amp;CK STIX 2.1 data&quot;, <br />  &quot;default&quot;: &quot;api/v21&quot;, <br />  &quot;api_roots&quot;: [ <br />    &quot;api/v21&quot; <br />  ] <br />} </pre><p>Great! Now that we have the API Root, let’s see if we can query for a list of available <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107500">TAXII Collections</a>:</p><pre>curl --request GET \  <br />    --url https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/ \  <br />    --header 'Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1' </pre><p>The response should look something like the following:</p><pre>{<br />  “collections”: [<br />    {<br />      “id”: “x-mitre-collection — 1f5f1533-f617–4ca8–9ab4–6a02367fa019”,<br />      “title”: “Enterprise ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      “description”: “ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise provides a knowledge base of real-world adversary behavior targeting traditional enterprise networks. ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise covers the following platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, PRE, Office 365, Google Workspace, IaaS, Network, and Containers.”,<br />      “canRead”: true,<br />      “canWrite”: false,<br />      “mediaTypes”: [<br />        “application/taxii+json;version=2.1”,<br />        “application/taxii+json”<br />      ]<br />    },<br />    {<br />      id”: “x-mitre-collection — 90c00720–636b-4485-b342–8751d232bf09”,<br />      “title”: “ICS ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      …<br />    },<br />    {<br />      “id”: “x-mitre-collection — dac0d2d7–8653–445c-9bff-82f934c1e858”,<br />      “title”: “Mobile ATT&amp;CK”,<br />      …<br />    }<br />  ]<br />}</pre><p>The response lists three objects that match the main ATT&amp;CK domains: Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS. Of note, <em>TAXII Collections</em> and <em>STIX Collections</em> are different concepts — with TAXII Collections operating as versatile containers for CTI objects. For our MITRE ATT&amp;CK TAXII server, we’ve mapped each TAXII Collection directly to an ATT&amp;CK domain. This means querying a TAXII Collection from our server provides data from just one domain, simplifying the user experience and aligning with the ATT&amp;CK framework. While this mapping isn’t required by the TAXII protocol and other servers may organize collections differently, we chose this method to make our server more intuitive for the ATT&amp;CK community.</p><p>Now that we have our API Root and the available TAXII Collections, we’re ready to <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/os/taxii-v2.1-os.html#_Toc31107539">retrieve some CTI objects</a>:</p><pre>curl --request GET \<br />  --url 'https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/x-mitre-collection--dac0d2d7-8653-445c-9bff-82f934c1e858/objects?limit=100' \<br />  --header ‘Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1’</pre><p>This request sends a request for the first 100 objects from the Enterprise ATT&amp;CK collection. The response should look something like this:</p><pre>{<br />  “more”: true,<br />  “next”: “1”,<br />  “objects”: [←100 →]<br />}</pre><p>If the ‘more’ property is set to true and the ‘next’ property is populated, then the client can paginate through the remaining records using the ‘next’ URL parameter along with the same original query options. So, we can request the second page of 100 objects by simply adding the ‘next=1’ query parameter to the original request:</p><pre>curl --request GET \  <br />    --url 'https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/collections/x-mitre-collection--dac0d2d7-8653-445c-9bff-82f934c1e858/objects?limit=100&amp;next=1' \  <br />    --header 'Accept: application/taxii+json;version=2.1' </pre><p><strong>What’s Next for ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1</strong></p><p>We believe the release of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 server is a big step forward for threat intelligence sharing — and we have even more exciting integrations on our roadmap to make the TAXII experience even smoother:</p><ul><li>Workbench UI indicators that signal whether an object or collection is actively being shared through TAXII;</li><li>Workbench UI toggles that allow users to pause (or enable) the sharing objects and collections with TAXII;</li><li>Workbench role-based access controls (RBAC) for TAXII administration.</li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we continue to evolve our tools!</p><p>©2024 The MITRE Corporation.

<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NdNL-P_jvIn29chXCd8RmA.jpeg" /></figure><h4>Enhancing usability, expanding scope, optimizing defenses</h4><p>2023 was dynamic year for ATT&amp;CK. We marked a decade of progress since the framework’s inception and achieved some key milestones to make ATT&amp;CK more accessible for a wider community. Our scope (slightly) expanded to encompass activities adjacent to direct Enterprise interactions, such as non-technical, deceptive practices and social engineering techniques (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1657/">Financial Theft</a>, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656/">Impersonation</a>, and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/">Spearphishing Voice</a>). We enhanced detection capabilities with integrated notes, pseudocode from <a href="https://car.mitre.org/">CAR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/bzar">BZAR</a>-based analytics. The ICS matrix welcomed the addition of <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/assets/">Assets</a> to enhance inter-sector communication and mapping. We rolled out Mobile-specific <a href="http://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">data sources</a>, structured detections, and behaviors like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660/">smishing, quishing, and vishing</a>. Website navigation was improved, along with a faster Search bar, and updates that hit you faster than you can say “<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/changelog.html">resources/changelog.html</a>”. We also maintained a steady cadence of updates and new content from the ATT&amp;CK team and external contributors.</p><p>In October, we successfully held <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/learn-more-about-attack/attackcon/october-2023/">ATT&amp;CKcon 4.0</a>, with new insights shared and realistic applications demonstrated by practitioners. And finally, we kickstarted the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/engage-with-attack/benefactors/">ATT&amp;CK Benefactor program</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BMDwDsQqdUFRS-B-t7MyTA.jpeg" /><figcaption>ATT&amp;CKcon 4.0 Themed Snacks</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>2024 Roadmap: Vision &amp; Goals</strong></h3><p>Since launching ATT&amp;CK, we’ve been humbled to witness how the community has integrated it across widely varied spheres and around the globe. The vision for ATT&amp;CK has always been to enable the broadest use across the widest spectrum of stakeholders — whether you’re cross-mapping between domains, annotating and developing tailored Navigator layers, or using the framework as a blueprint to build multi-platform threat models. ATT&amp;CK was designed to empower defenders precisely where they need it most. This is the core thesis for ATT&amp;CK, and as its stewards, we’ll continue prioritizing measures that advance a more inclusive, relevant, and actionable framework.</p><p>In line with this vision, our 2024 goals are to bolster broader usability and enhance actionable defensive measures for practitioners across every domain. This includes exploring scope adjustments and platform rebalancing, as well as implementing structural modifications with the introduction of ICS sub-techniques. A core focus will be reinforcing defensive mechanisms and optimizing their user-friendliness. We’ll be bridging Linux and macOS information gaps and enhancing prominent adversary representation. The ATT&amp;CK Navigator, Workbench, and website will feature reengineering to improve accessibility and enable swifter ATT&amp;CK Group/Software/Campaign updates. We’ll also be sunsetting the TAXII 2.0 server by December 18 in favor of the upgraded TAXII 2.1 version. Finally, we’ll continue amplifying the key driver behind ATT&amp;CK — community collaboration. This includes hosting ATT&amp;CKcon 5.0 in October, and maintaining support for the <a href="https://www.attack-community.org">European Union (EU)</a> and <a href="https://na.eventscloud.com/website/67610/">Asia-Pacific (APAC) ATT&amp;CK Community</a> Workshops.</p><h3><strong>Enterprise | Integrated Defense</strong></h3><p>In tune with ATT&amp;CK’s vision, we’re continuously re-evaluating Enterprise’s scope to more accurately reflect the threats faced by real defenders. Matrices and platforms are conceptual schematics, not real-world structures, and we’re assessing realignments, expansions, and refinements of platforms to represent interconnected organizations, the adversaries they encounter, and the reality of defenders. Our goal is to advance a cohesive and integrated framework that provides more functional use cases and empowers users to visualize and create adaptable defenses against cross-platform threats.</p><p><strong>Cloud | Matrix Balance &amp; More Actionability</strong></p><p>Our Cloud goal this year is to enable defenders (both new and seasoned) to better leverage the Cloud matrix for defensive action. This includes focusing on emerging and significant threats to the domain, upgrading Cloud analytics, and optimizing the balance between generalization and detail in the matrix.</p><p>With a considerable portion of cloud identities retaining super admin access, and the frequency of identity-related intrusions across the domain, we’ve been reinforcing and creating more detailed techniques for identity-based attacks. We’ll also be diving into the exploitation of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and the malicious use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Our Cloud analytics effort will elevate your actionability, by outlining the steps to detect specific behaviors, and providing additional context on what to find and collect.</p><p>We’ll also be evaluating how to best refine the balance between abstraction and specificity in the matrix. Our exploration will assess if the platforms are broad enough to cover a wide range of cloud environments and threats, yet specific enough to inform defensive actions. This balance is crucial for the matrix to remain practical and useful for defenders operating in diverse cloud environments. Our aim is to make navigating the Cloud matrix more intuitive and enable users to prioritize techniques relevant to their specific platform.</p><p>Ready to navigate the Cloud with us? Sail over to #<a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035Z0AL8R0"><strong>cloud_attack</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>macOS/Linux | Countermeasures for Priv Esc and Defense Evasion</strong></p><p>Our goal for Linux and macOS is to equip practitioners with more robust countermeasures and help bridge the information gap on defending these systems. We’ll continue tracking down in-the-wild adversary behaviors and building more macOS and Linux-only (sub)techniques to optimize defensive arsenals. For Linux we’ll be exploring privilege escalation and defense evasion to better align with in-the-wild adversary activity. On the macOS side, we’ll be strategically bolstering the platform, with a particular emphasis on threats associated with elevated permissions.</p><p>If you have intelligence or technique ideas, we would love to collaborate. We rely on the practitioners who work with these systems day-in and day-out to help us identify gaps and provide invaluable insights. Ready to contribute? <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">email us</a> and join our <strong>#</strong><a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035BUEMMHP"><strong>linux_attack</strong></a> or <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C0351D4AU1J"><strong>#macos_attack</strong></a> slack channel.</p><h3><strong>Defensive Coverage | Upgrading, Converting &amp; Restructuring Defensive Measures</strong></h3><p>Our Defensive goal this year is to expand detections and mitigations to help you better optimize your detection engineering — and maybe get a little more actionable. The April release will include both new and updated mitigations that incorporate best practices from contributors, and industry standards meticulously mapped by our defense team.</p><p>Over the past few months, we’ve also been examining analytic language approaches. Our aim? Transforming detection logic into formats compatible with different security tools, including more consistent with real-world query languages such as Splunk . This will simplify the process of aligning your SIEM data with ATT&amp;CK detections, making it easier to understand. We’re also incorporating data collection sources for a given detection query. For example, pulling information from Windows Event logs or Sysmon and the associated Event Code. The new analytic style in ATT&amp;CK will overhal the previously used CAR-like pseudocode, and will be the model for future analytics. This will enhance compatibility across various environments and help you hunt threats more efficiently.</p><p>Lately, we’ve been prioritizing improving detections under the Execution tactic, where some of the most employed techniques fall. v15 will showcase a subset of these enhanced detections, featuring the trifecta of <a href="https://car.mitre.org/">CAR</a> (Cyber Analytics Repository) pseudocode, <a href="https://github.com/mitre-attack/bzar">BZAR</a>-based analytics (Bro/Zeek ATT&amp;CK-based Analytics and Reporting) and detection notes.</p><p>Gearing up for October, we’ll be completing the enhanced detections for Execution, sculpting out Credential Access detections, exploring the universe of Cloud analytics, and navigating how to restructure our data sources for improved accessibility. This means sprucing up data source definitions and matching them to everyday use cases like sensor mappings. This way, you can more easily identify the tools and events that clue you in on shady activity. Additionally, you can opt for the data sources that best align with your specific needs. The revamp will also include the introduction of STIX IDs for data components, making it more intuitive to reference and integrate data sources.</p><p>Join our ranks at <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036RA0B7EX"><strong>#defensive_attack</strong></a> channel.</p><h3><strong>ICS | Subs, Asset Expansion, &amp; Cross-Domain Integration</strong></h3><p>ICS is leveling up this year. Our goals include broadening ICS horizons with new asset coverage, exploring platform scope expansion, and continuing our multi-domain integration quest. We’ll also be diving deeper into adversary behaviors with the introduction of sub-techniques. v15 will showcase some of integration efforts, with the release of cross-mapped campaigns. These campaigns track IT to OT attack sequences, helping defenders better understand multi-domain intrusions and informing unified defense strategies across technology environments.</p><p>The October release will feature a structural shake-up, with the first tranche of the long-awaited sub-techniques. Like Enterprise and Mobile sub-techniques, ICS subs will break down techniques into more detail. This increased granularity allows defenders to understand the nuances of adversaries’ execution of a given technique, enhancing their ability to detect and mitigate them. The technique restructuring will involve modifying the name and scope of techniques and integrating them more effectively with other domains. This integration will foster a more comprehensive defensive approach on both the right and left of launch. You can expect a subs crosswalk to help you understand our decisions and how things map between deprecated and new techniques.</p><p>October will also include some additional treats with Asset coverage expansion, building upon the <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-v14-fa473603f86b">Asset refactoring in v14</a>. The refactoring strived to provide a clearer picture of the devices, systems, or platforms a specific technique could target and introduced the concept of Related Assets. Related Assets links cross-sector Assets that share similar functions, capabilities, and architectural locations/properties, highlighting that they may also be susceptible to the same techniques. v16 will feature additional Related Assets, as well as more in-depth definitions and refined mappings of technique relationships for different devices and systems. You can start leveraging Assets for your defensive activities by viewing the technique mappings from <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/assets/">Asset</a> pages, or by reviewing Asset mappings from a technique page. We’ll also be scouting how to incorporate additional sectors such as such as maritime, rail, and electric.</p><p>We welcome input from all sectors on how to improve identification of key assets and any additional adversary behaviors you have observed in the wild. Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a> or <strong>#</strong><a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C061YMN07M1"><strong>ics_attack</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Mobile | Detections &amp; Mitigations Optimization + PRE Exploration</strong></h3><p>Mobile’s goal is to dial up the pre-and-post-compromise defensive measures this year, with a detections and mitigations upgrade and an exploratory mission into pre-intrusion behaviors for the matrix. We introduced Mobile structured detections in v14 and will continue building out structured detections as well as expanding our mitigations across the matrix. For optimal actionability, we’ll be leveraging the best practices and tangible experiences from the mobile security community.</p><p>In the coming months we’ll also be evaluating how to enhance inter-domain connectivity across platforms and exploring integrating proactive tactics into the Mobile matrix. Our goal is to better reflect evolving adversary activity targeting the domain. This research quest will examine adversary actions before attacks, like active and passive <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/">Reconnaissance</a>, and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0042/">acquiring or developing resources</a> for targeting purposes.</p><p>Collaboration and knowledge-sharing with the community will to be a driver for Mobile’s development in 2024. In addition to ramping up detections and mitigations, we’re particularly interested in partnering with mobile defenders to examine potential areas where communications platforms or domains could be added into ATT&amp;CK. If you’re interested, connect via <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a> or join <strong>#</strong><a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036CEG4VRP"><strong>mobile_attack</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h3><strong>Software Development | Enhanced Usability &amp; Streamlined Workflows</strong></h3><p>Our Software goals this year are to increase usability across ATT&amp;CK Workbench and Navigator, and streamline Groups and Software releases. Adversaries evolve quickly, so we’re optimizing Workbench workflows to harmonize Group and Software releases more closely to their cadence. This includes developing enhanced search capabilities, improving ATT&amp;CK object-collection association, and overhauling the Collection Manager UI for the ATT&amp;CK Workbench. These renovations will fine-tune the approval of ATT&amp;CK object changes and the matching of collection bundle differences with official ATT&amp;CK changelog types, resulting in swifter releases.</p><p>For ATT&amp;CK Navigator, we’re refining the user experience, <em>and</em> the experience of anyone reading your reports. We’ll be upgrading SVG export function for sleeker output designs, providing smoother navigation with intuitive export controls, and rolling out an in-website tutorial for mastery of all the key features. We’ll also be updating the official content source to the STIX 2.1 repository — making everything a little more robust and flexible.</p><p>Finally, we’re taking our TAXII server to the next level! We’ll be sunsetting the TAXII 2.0 server by December 18, as we transition to the upgraded TAXII 2.1 version. You can access the documentation for TAXII 2.1 server in our <a href="http://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server">GitHub repository</a>. Remember to switch URLs for TAXII 2.1 clients to connect to <a href="https://attack-taxii.mitre.org">https://attack-taxii.mitre.org</a> instead of <a href="https://cti-taxii.mitre.org.">https://cti-taxii.mitre.org.</a> And get ready to experience enhanced features and smoother operations.</p><h3><strong>Cyber Threat Intelligence | More Cybercriminal, Underrepresented Groups</strong></h3><p>With CTI, our mission is to better reflect the reality of the threat landscape by infusing more cybercriminal and underreported adversary activity into the framework. By bridging gaps in representation and minimizing those unknowns, we aim to provide defenders with better insights and tools to counter a wider array of threats. A pivotal aspect of this effort includes gap assessments of Groups, Software, and Campaigns. These evaluations will help us pinpoint any disparities between the current content and the reality of adversary activities.</p><p>Our releases this year will feature more cybercriminal operations and under-monitored regions, including Latin America, offering a more nuanced understanding of global threats. We’re also collaborating with ATT&amp;CK domain leads to expand coverage of cross-domain intrusions to inform a more unified approach to undermining adversaries.</p><p>To join this quest, engage at <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a></p><h3><strong>Community Collaboration</strong></h3><p><strong>ATT&amp;CK Community Workshops | Practitioner-led Forums for Activating ATT&amp;CK</strong></p><p>We’re always inspired to see how ATT&amp;CK is being used in innovative ways to upgrade defensive capabilities. The regional ATT&amp;CK community workshops — organized by practitioners, for practitioners — provide forums to share insights, use cases, and collaborative approaches for leveraging ATT&amp;CK.</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.attack-community.org/event/">European Union (EU)</a> ATT&amp;CK Community workshop, hosted by the <a href="https://ccb.belgium.be/en">Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium </a>and supported by the <a href="https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/">Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID)</a> was the first regional ATT&amp;CK workshop, The 2024 iteration will take place in Brussels, Belgium on May 17, in-person and virtually.</li><li>The <a href="https://na.eventscloud.com/website/67610/">Asia-Pacific (APAC) ATT&amp;CK Community Workshop</a>, hosted by the by the <a href="https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/center-for-threat-informed-defense/">CTID</a>, launches this April 25–26 in Singapore, and <a href="https://na.eventscloud.com/esurvey/index.php?surveyid=119679&amp;st=11ed3b2537a57f262963e9006f1f47b114c68f6f">virtual attendance</a> is still open. The Workshop will advance threat-informed defense through hands-on training, ATT&amp;CK best practices, worst practices, and moonshot approaches.</li></ul><p><strong>ATT&amp;CKcon 5.0 | Great Speakers, Content, &amp; Conversations around ATT&amp;CK</strong></p><p><strong>ATT&amp;CKcon 5.0 </strong>will be arriving October 22–23, featuring both virtual and in-person attendance from McLean, VA. Stay tuned to our Twitter and LinkedIn channels for updates on our Call for Presentations, which will open in the coming months, followed by our illustrious speaker lineup. If your organization is thinking about joining the ATT&amp;CKcon adventure as a sponsor, please reach out to us at attackcon@mitre.org.</p><p><strong>Benefactor Program | Empowering Defenders, Sustaining Independence</strong></p><p>We want to take a moment to share some insights into the foundational tenants and financial realities of ATT&amp;CK. Much like we crowd-source intelligence and rely on community contributions, ATT&amp;CK itself was built to be independent, responsive, and part of the global community.</p><p>From the outset, we deliberately chose not to align ATT&amp;CK with any specific government department or agency. This decision was made to maintain autonomy, flexibility, and to foster collaboration across the broadest spectrum of stakeholders. While this approach has facilitated agility and international partnerships, it also means that ATT&amp;CK lacks a dedicated funding source.</p><p>To bridge this funding gap and ensure the continuity of our operations, as well as expanding into new domains, we launched the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/engage-with-attack/benefactors/">Benefactor Program</a> last year. This program enables tax-deductible, charitable donations from individuals and organizations who believe in ATT&amp;CK’s mission. These contributions allow us to continue offering free and accessible services while also advancing our capabilities and scope.</p><p>We are <strong>immensely grateful</strong> for the support we have received thus far from initial benefactors SOC Prime, Tidal Cyber, and Zimperium. We remain committed to serving the community with transparency; whether you’re a contributor, a fellow defender, or just getting started, we thank you for being part of ATT&amp;CK’s journey.</p><h3><strong>Looking Forward</strong></h3><p>Mark your calendars for the v15 release on April 23! You’ll see some novel content interspersed with familiar elements, as well as more practical defensive measures.</p><p>As always, we value the opportunity to collaborate with you in ensuring that ATT&amp;CK remains a living framework, where each contribution, conversation, or new implementation fuels its evolution. We look forward to continuing this adventure with you.</p><p>Connect with us on <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MITREattack">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mitre-att&amp;ck/">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a>.</p><p>©2024 The MITRE Corporation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>A Roadmap of 2023’s key efforts: From ICS Assets to more Linux and ATT&amp;CKcon 4.0.</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pZsmRwpPNtBygO-4zxDVLQ.png" /></figure><p>It’s 2023 and we’re all a little older, including ATT&amp;CK, which will be celebrating its 8th (!) release anniversary in a few short months. Last year we matured, expanded, deconflicted, and renovated the knowledge base, persevering through challenges to meet our <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-2022-roadmap-cd5a1a3387c7">2022 goals</a>. Some of our most notable efforts including unveiling <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">Enterprise structured detections</a>, publishing <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">Mobile sub-techniques</a>, introducing <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/">ICS detections</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">transitioning ATT&amp;CK for ICS</a> to the mothership (aka attack.mitre.org), launching <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-campaigns-6b15baa6cbb4">Campaigns</a>, and hosting <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/attackcon/">ATT&amp;CKcon 3.0</a>.</p><p>The ATT&amp;CK team also trekked around the U.S. and the globe to talk about ATT&amp;CK for defenders, threat hunters, and cyber threat intelligence analysts. We held riveting conversations about purple teaming, discussed best practices for adversary emulation, and connected over common misuses of ATT&amp;CK. You inspired us with your stories, insights and expertise, and we’re thrilled to continue collaborating with you in 2023.</p><h3><strong>2023 Roadmap</strong></h3><p>Our focus areas in 2023 will be targeted growth and integration. We’ll be maintaining framework stability as we build out content and structure, while expanding and increasing the scope of some of ATT&amp;CK’s current platforms. We’ll be looking for places where we can add defensive “easy buttons” to ATT&amp;CK and other ways we can improve for lower-resourced defenders. Relatedly, we’ll also be working to enhance the usability, accessibility, and functionality of the ATT&amp;CK website and Navigator. These updates and more will be mainly centered on our April and October releases.</p><p><strong>Linux | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>We made significant progress in updating the macOS platform last year, and while we’ll continue evolving that content, we’ve officially transitioned the spotlight to Linux for 2023. April’s release will feature Linux contributions (thank you, contributors!) that focus on modifications to parent technique scope, including new sub-techniques and updated procedures.</p><p>For the October release, we’re targeting an expanded representation of Linux within ATT&amp;CK. We’re looking to not only better account for activity within on-premise Linux servers, but some of the broader Linux-based (and not always x86) spaces adversaries have been abusing. This will be a substantial effort given how under reported Linux activity is, and the Linux security community’s input is essential for us to improve this platform. We’re working to build out opportunities to connect both online and offline and would like to hear how you’d like to collaborate. In the interim, whether you have specific insights to share, or would just like to talk about ATT&amp;CK for Linux in general, email us and join the <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C035BUEMMHP">#<strong>linux_attack</strong></a> channel on the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">ATT&amp;CK slack</a>.</p><p><strong>Defensive Coverage | October 2023</strong></p><p>When we added explicit pairing of <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025">detections to data sources in ATT&amp;CK v11</a>, it was intended to let you identify the inputs you need to collect (Data Sources), combined with how to analyze that data to identify a given Technique (detection). We’ll be leveling up this year, exploring and including in ATT&amp;CK more specifics on what you as defenders can be collecting related to detections and how. This quest will result in an more directly usable guidance for defenders, as well as a more in-depth look at data collection, analyzation, and identification of a given technique.</p><p>We will also be assessing ATT&amp;CK mitigations for gaps and potential improvements this year. We converted mitigations into objects in v5 to increase their usability, and our goal has always been to continue to evolve and improve that knowledge base. Over the next several months, we’ll be researching new preventions and crafting out additional ways to prevent a given technique from succeeding. If you’d like to contribute to either of these quests, <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">let us know</a> or join us in the <a href="https://mitreattack.slack.com/archives/C036RA0B7EX"><strong>#defensive_attack</strong></a> channel in our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a>.</p><p><strong>ICS | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>This will be ICS’s first full year on the ATT&amp;CK site, and we’ll be making additions across the matrix, including more cross-domain mappings (e.g., ICS + Enterprise). We’ll be sharing more details about this and our approach to leveraging ATT&amp;CK for holistic ICS defense in an upcoming blog post.</p><p>Over the next several months, we’ll be focusing on addressing overlaps and integration with other domains (primarily between Enterprise and ICS, although Mobile could be included) and revamping ICS <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0039/">Assets</a>. This effort will focus on evaluating Assets in various industries, identifying their interrelations, and determining how they fit into the ATT&amp;CK structure.</p><p>If you’d like to share contributions or have other inputs for ICS, <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">connect with us!</a></p><p><strong>Mobile | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>We released Mobile sub-techniques last summer, and we’ll continue expanding on those, as well as building out contributions, and collaborating on enhancing multi-domain techniques. Mobile-specific Data Source objects are another goal this year, and they’ll mirror the concept of Data Source objects that <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-v10-7743870b37e3">Enterprise and ICS currently leverage</a>, informing a more detailed and defined data collection strategy. The Mobile Data Sources will eventually be featured on both the overall <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">Data Sources list</a> as well as the individual Data Source pages. For October, we plan on charting out <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-goes-to-v11-599a9112a025?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">structured </a><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/">detections</a>, to enable you to enhance your Mobile detections approach.</p><p>A core focus for the domain overall is bolstering our collaboration with the mobile security community. Along with the rest of ATT&amp;CK, Mobile’s matrix is mostly crowdsourced, and we rely on the deep expertise from the mobile community to validate our content and help us to mature this knowledge base. If you’d like to contribute to this space or start a conversation, <a href="http://attack@mitre.org/">reach out</a> to partner with us.</p><p><strong>Campaigns | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>We don’t typically highlight all the updates we’ll be making to ATT&amp;CK Techniques, Software, or Groups, but as the <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-campaigns-6b15baa6cbb4">newest object on the block</a>, we figured you might be curious about our plans for Campaigns this year. Over the next few months, we’ll be extracting significant Campaigns from several APT groups in ATT&amp;CK and adding them to the knowledge base. Closer to October, we’ll pivot to building out campaigns conducted by criminal groups, including ransomware operations. If you’d like to contribute or just share your thoughts on Campaigns, <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">let’s have a conversation</a>!</p><p><strong>Cloud | April &amp; October 2023</strong></p><p>Since initially releasing ATT&amp;CK for Cloud in October 2019 (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-october-2019/index.html">v6</a>), we have continually worked to <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-engenuity/research-partnership-matures-att-ck-for-cloud-d232998968ce">expand and refine how these platforms fit within the broader ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise</a>. Cloud introduces many new challenges for defenders, as well as potential opportunities to rethink how we describe adversary behaviors. For example, how does our understanding of tactics such as Execution, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration change when considering cloud environments?</p><p>Throughout 2023 we will work to adapt these definitions with the goal of helping everyone (cloud expert or not) better understand and utilize ATT&amp;CK for Cloud.

We’ll be hosting 4.0 in-person and virtually from McLean, VA October 24–25 this year. Watch our <a href="https://twitter.com/mitreattack/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/mitre-att&amp;ck">LinkedIn</a> for announcements on our CFP when it opens in the next few months, followed by our lineup of speakers in late summer. If your organization is interested in sponsoring ATT&amp;CKcon, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:attackcon@mitre.org">attackcon@mitre.org</a>.</p><h3><strong>Here’s to (all) of You</strong></h3><p>We received an exceptional number of contributions across domains and platforms last year and are incredibly grateful for the support. ATT&amp;CK will always be community-driven and we’d like to thank each and every one of you that took the time to submit contributions, share research and new use cases, and join us in innumerable ATT&amp;CK discussions.</p><p>We’re looking forward to another great year of collaboration and can’t wait to connect with you in-person or via <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">email</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mitreattack">Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/mitreattack/shared_invite/zt-ny1a3yon-XkT_OS1IF~ZYrESq8Xtqjg">Slack</a>!</p><p>©2023 The MITRE Corporation.

Our initial collection of Campaigns will be available starting with our ATT&amp;CK v12 release on October 25, when you’ll be able to leverage the Campaigns structure for all of your ATT&amp;CK use cases. Prior to the release, we’re taking the opportunity to walk you through our vision for Campaigns, give you a tour of Campaigns elements, and cover our longer-term Campaigns plans.</p><p><strong>The Campaigns Vision</strong></p><p>For our purposes in ATT&amp;CK, we use “Campaigns” to describe a grouping of intrusion activity conducted over a specific period of time with common targets and objectives. A key aspect of Campaigns is that the activity may or may not be linked to a specific threat actor.</p><p>Our vision for Campaigns is to provide users with another way to view the evolution of malicious cyber operations. Threat actor activity in ATT&amp;CK currently encompasses a broad set of behaviors that can inform a holistic picture of the adversary over time. But as adversaries evolve, their TTPs often change, and by introducing some structure with Campaigns, we hope to allow you to glean more actionable intelligence and context to inform your defense prioritization<strong>. </strong>Campaigns will enable you to identify trends, track significant changes in techniques used by various actors, and monitor the introduction of new capabilities (or exploited vulnerabilities). You’ll also be able to identify continued threat actor reliance on certain techniques regardless of the campaign objective and/or targets.</p><p>Campaigns will also allow us to more accurately categorize complex intrusion activity, including those involving multiple threats (such as Ransomware-as-a-Service operations) and parse out overlapping operations that have been given the same name. With the new structure, we’ll also be converting some of the Groups in ATT&amp;CK to Campaigns. This will apply to Groups that meet our definition of a Campaign and only feature one cluster of activity (such as G0101/Frankenstein and G0014/Night Dragon).</p><p>As is our tradition of carefully integrating structural elements in ATT&amp;CK, we’ll be incorporating a limited number of Campaigns into the v12 release. This initial collection of Campaigns will feature former Group entries that are more accurately categorized as Campaigns, a curated number of Campaigns linked to existing Groups, as well as unattributed Campaigns.</p><p><strong>Campaign Elements</strong></p><p>We structured Campaigns to visually align with Groups and Software pages, and the v12 release will feature an addition of a new “Campaigns” button on the main page tool bar for easy access.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/649/1*rRkWQX7KklJV1lZ0H9pEhQ.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 1: Example of the new ATT&amp;CK tool bar with the “Campaigns” button.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Campaigns homepage will include a Campaigns table featuring ID number, Name, and activity descriptions. The list of available Campaigns in the left column highlights the Campaigns added or converted to date. As we previously covered, we created some flexibility in terms of whether or not the activity was given a unique name — a limitation we currently face with Groups — by allowing a Campaign to be simply referenced by our own identifier (e.g., C0014) if it doesn’t already come with a name.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/958/1*VpfouMBhClv5Zek8VGelyg.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 2: A draft Campaign table, with unnamed activity referenced as C0014.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each Campaign entry will feature a description of the intrusion activity, including details like known targeted countries and sectors where available, as well as any information that makes this Campaign particularly noteworthy.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4gW0dKk2KpkpJTTq2HvYtw.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 3: A draft Campaign page for all of the Trekkies out there!</em></figcaption></figure><p>Something we’ve been particularly mindful of is how to best capture the period of time related to a Campaign. We opted for the “First Seen” and “Last Seen” fields in the information box, with the corresponding reference citations, so users can see how a Campaign was scoped. For intrusion activity assessed to be ongoing at the time of report publication, we’ll add language to that affect in the Campaign description (e.g., “As of September 2022 security researchers assessed this activity was ongoing”) and update future versions of ATT&amp;CK Campaign entries accordingly.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/702/1*hFnZT2dOn2qoueCEwvBA9g.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 4: An example Campaigns information box with time frame fields and citations.</em></figcaption></figure><p>As with Groups and Software, we’ve created a “Techniques Used” table to capture actor procedure examples observed during a Campaign, with a couple of significant differences.</p><p>1. We’ll add as much detail as reporting allows regarding specific commands or steps taken by the actors, to help ATT&amp;CK users identify corresponding detection and mitigation opportunities. We’ve found this concept to be more challenging for Group and Software pages, as those tend to aggregate a variety of reporting examples over time, resulting in more generic procedure example language.</p><p>2. We’ll preface our Campaign procedure examples with the Campaign name or associated ID number, to separate it from techniques already found on a Group page. We realize the utility of this may not be immediately evident while looking at a Campaign page, but this allows for the procedure examples to stand out separately when a Campaign is associated with a Group (and, hopefully, allows for smoother integration in the future if an unattributed Campaign is later attributed to a Group).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/790/1*Od0xrpCbicBcN1AeD8S18w.png" /><figcaption><em>Figure 5: Separate procedure examples as seen from a Group page, based on a fictional Campaign. The top line is the existing procedure example for T1566.001 for a Group, while the second line is specifically related to the associated Campaign.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>What does this mean for Groups and Software?</strong></p><p>We’ve made two key changes to Group and Software pages as they relate to Campaigns. As previously mentioned, techniques and corresponding procedure examples mapped to a Group-attributed Campaign will carry over to the associated Group page. We’ll also continue to map Campaign-specific procedure examples to Software pages.</p><p>We’ve added a Campaigns table to associated Group and Software pages, so ATT&amp;CK users can easily reference Campaign ID numbers, Names (when applicable), and the Campaign description.</p><p>Group and Software pages will otherwise remain visually unchanged, and we’ll continue to update them separately as a collective list of all observed techniques. We want to preserve the functionality of ATT&amp;CK Navigator Layers in that respect, for ATT&amp;CK users who want to focus on all techniques used regardless of time or target.</p><p><strong>Introducing the Campaign STIX Object</strong></p><p>With the addition of Campaigns to ATT&amp;CK, the ATT&amp;CK Data Model (which can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md#the-attck-data-model">Usage document</a>), has expanded to encompass these changes. The diagram below portrays how all the moving pieces work together, with the new additions of the Campaign object type and the Relationships connected to Campaigns. It’s important to note, there are no changes to objects that previously existed in ATT&amp;CK. Software written to read earlier versions of ATT&amp;CK should continue to work, albeit missing data that only appears in Campaigns.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jVbUes3GwidA_ionbx6hbw.png" /><figcaption>Figure 6: Campaign STIX relationships</figcaption></figure><p>Now that you’ve seen our data model, we’d like to introduce you to the star of the show — the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.0/csprd01/part2-stix-objects/stix-v2.0-csprd01-part2-stix-objects.html#_Toc476230925">STIX Campaign object</a>. As a part of the ATT&amp;CK Data Model, it makes use of the same STIX extensions that can be found there, such as x_mitre_version. However, in addition to those previously documented fields, here is the breakdown of how ATT&amp;CK utilizes each field that is unique to the Campaign object:<br /> <br /> Standard STIX fields:</p><ul><li>type: Follows the STIX specification</li><li>name: The name used to identify the Campaign. If no name is given, then this field will contain an ATT&amp;CK identifier in the form CXXXX</li><li>description: Follows the STIX specification</li><li>aliases: Used to hold associated Campaign names</li><li>first_seen (timestamp): The time frame that this Campaign was first seen. ATT&amp;CK makes use of this field only to the level of granularity of month/year. The day and time part of this timestamp field should be ignored by parsers when displaying ATT&amp;CK Campaign information</li><li>last_seen (timestamp): The time that this Campaign was last seen or reported. ATT&amp;CK makes use of this field only to the level of granularity of month/year. The day and time part of this timestamp field should be ignored by parsers when displaying ATT&amp;CK Campaign information</li><li>objective: Not used by ATT&amp;CK</li></ul><p>Extensions of the STIX Spec:</p><ul><li>x_mitre_first_seen_citation (string): One to many citations for when the Campaign was first reported in the form “(Citation: &lt;citation name&gt;)” where &lt;citation name&gt; can be found as one of the source_name of one of the external_references.</li><li>x_mitre_last_seen_citation (string): One to many citations for when the Campaign was last reported in the form “(Citation: &lt;citation name&gt;)” where &lt;citation name&gt; can be found as one of the source_name of one of the external_references.</li></ul><p>As mentioned above, we have also added <strong>three new STIX Relationships</strong> that connect Campaigns to the rest of the ecosystem; namely that Campaigns can optionally be <strong>attributed to a Group, use Software, or use Techniques</strong>. The STIX Relationship objects themselves have no special modifications from the STIX standard and simply connect Campaigns to those previously existing objects. At a glance this seems straightforward enough, but there are some things to be aware of if you are parsing ATT&amp;CK v12 STIX going forward.</p><p>When gathering data about Groups that have Campaigns attributed to them, it’s a bit more complex to parse out all the Techniques and Software that are used by the Group. For Campaigns associated with a Group, we won’t be creating relationships between techniques and Software in that Campaign and the Group, if you would like to view the inclusive list, you’ll need to combine technique sets and Software usage.</p><p><strong>Combining Technique Sets: </strong>To get a comprehensive Group Technique view, you’ll need to combine the set of Techniques that are directly used by the Group with the set of Techniques used by all of their associated Campaigns.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/638/1*1k6NxIMlGneRco1xvLe_1w.png" /><figcaption>Figure 7: Example of Group Technique STIX inheritance</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mapping Software Object Usage:</strong> To holistically map out Software object usage, you’ll identify the Groups, the Group-attributed Campaigns, and the unattributed Campaigns using the Software, and combine them for the full picture.</p><p>For further technical details on how to handle retrieving all Techniques or Software that a Group uses starting with the v12 release and how it differs from the v11 and prior releases, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md#relationships-microlibrary">Relationships Microlibrary</a> section of the <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md">GitHub Usage</a> document.</p><p><strong>What to Expect Going Forward</strong></p><p>We’ll continue modifying and building out Campaigns, with the eventual goal of revisiting a major Group pages in ATT&amp;CK and reconstructing earlier Campaigns to reflect how these actors have evolved over time. We’ll also shift focus from one-off or unattributed Campaigns to more complex Campaigns attributed to some of the more populated Group entries, such as the SolarWinds intrusion and <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/">G0016/APT29</a>.</p><p>Campaigns will also serve a key role in tying together the various ATT&amp;CK matrices — Enterprise (Cloud, Containers, macOS, and Linux), Mobile, and ICS, to further document how adversaries pivot across these domains using a variety of techniques to accomplish their objectives.</p><p>We greatly appreciate the community’s feedback on Campaigns to date, and as we continue to develop Campaigns, we welcome your input.

<h3>ATT&amp;CK Goes to v11: Structured Detections, Beta Sub-Techniques for Mobile, and ICS Joins the Band</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JB9ySNw5GWctTPIxbjYlng.jpeg" /><figcaption>These go to eleven</figcaption></figure><p>By <a href="https://medium.com/u/37fd2c032d44">Adam Pennington</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/a4d96b83d947">Jason Ajmo</a></p><p>Right on cue, ATT&amp;CK’s latest release is out, and this time we’ve gone to v11! If you’ve been following along with our <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-2022-roadmap-cd5a1a3387c7">roadmap</a> there shouldn’t be any huge surprises in store, but we wanted to take a chance to go over our latest changes. The <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/resources/updates/updates-april-2022/">v11 set list</a> includes detections now paired with related Data Sources: Data Components, a beta version of sub-techniques for ATT&amp;CK for Mobile, ATT&amp;CK for ICS on attack.mitre.org, as well as regular updates/additions across Techniques, Software, and Groups.</p><h3>ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise Structured Detections</h3><p>Over the past few years, transforming various actionable ATT&amp;CK fields into managed objects has been a reoccurring theme. In v5 of ATT&amp;CK, we converted mitigations into objects to enhance their value and usability — with this conversion, you can now identify a <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/">mitigation</a> and pivot to various techniques it can potentially prevent. This has been a feature that many of you have leveraged to <a href="https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-control-framework-mappings">map ATT&amp;CK to different control/risk frameworks</a>. We previously converted data sources to objects for <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/introducing-attack-v10-7743870b37e3">the v10 release</a>, enabling similar pivoting and analysis opportunities.</p><p>In today’s v11 release we’ve taken a parallel approach for detections in Enterprise ATT&amp;CK, taking the previously free text detections featured in Techniques, and have refined and merged them into descriptions that are connected to Data Sources. We have typically tried to match the detection text on a Technique to its Data Sources, but this makes the paring explicit. This will let you now see for each detection what you need to collect as inputs (Data Sources) paired with how you could analyze that data to identify a given Technique (detection). Below is an example of how Data Sources and Detections have changed for <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/">Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets (T1558)</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RNQMfeHnbQ_Hl9yY_v4E1g.png" /><figcaption>Data sources and detections in ATT&amp;CK v10 for Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets (T1558)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*L0AwG3Z0VkPk_RO6g-G1gg.png" /><figcaption>Data sources and detections in ATT&amp;CK v11 for Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets (T1558)</figcaption></figure><p>Detections will also now be included on <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">Data Source pages</a>, associated with each Technique listed for a Data Component.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p-dY4rNMtsq51NoNmZr_zQ.png" /></figure><p>As with everything else in ATT&amp;CK, these new detections also appear in our STIX as a part of the “detects” relationship added in our last ATT&amp;CK release in its “description” field. For more information about ATT&amp;CK’s STIX representation, including the data source objects and relationships added in ATT&amp;CK v10, you can check out our <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md">STIX usage document</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/793/1*j5LUee-vgAzhPIGAqP5A8g.png" /></figure><h3>Mobile Sub-Techniques Beta</h3><p>In 2020, <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-with-sub-techniques-is-now-just-attack-8fc20997d8de">we added Sub-Techniques to ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise</a>. In the time since, they’ve been well-received and solved some of the growth issues we were having in our biggest matrix. As ATT&amp;CK’s Mobile Lead Jason Ajmo <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-for-mobile-2022-roadmap-4fdb40a88a48">recently talked about</a> in the ATT&amp;CK Blog, we’re now bringing this improvement to ATT&amp;CK for Mobile as a beta release. The content on the main ATT&amp;CK site now contains the Sub-Techniques beta, and the current, stable Mobile content can be accessed at <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/matrices/mobile/">https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v10/matrices/mobile/</a>. We plan on making ATT&amp;CK for Mobile with Sub-Techniques final this summer, after we’ve given the community time to check out the content, get ready for it, and send us any feedback they have to <a href="mailto:attack@mitre.org">attack@mitre.org</a>. Until that time, the <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/master/mobile-attack">main STIX representation</a> of ATT&amp;CK for Mobile will remain the v10 pre-Sub-Techniques version.</p><h4>How can I move to the beta ATT&amp;CK for Mobile with sub-techniques?</h4><p>First, you’ll need to support some changes to Mobile ATT&amp;CK’s technique structure necessary to support sub-techniques. If you’re already using or have moved to versions of ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise with sub-techniques, the structural changes and the process of moving are identical. As with ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise, we’ve expanded Mobile technique IDs to identify corresponding sub-techniques: T[technique].[sub-technique]. In Mobile’s STIX representation of ATT&amp;CK we’ve added the “x_mitre_is_subtechnique = true” to “attack-pattern” objects that represent a sub-technique, and “subtechnique-of” relationships between techniques and sub-techniques. Both are already contained in our <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/blob/master/USAGE.md">STIX documentation</a>. You can find a STIX representation of ATT&amp;CK that includes the v11 Mobile Beta <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/releases/tag/ATT%26CK-v11.0-mobile-beta">here</a>.</p><p>Next, if you want to get a head start and remap your content from a previous version of Mobile ATT&amp;CK, to this beta release. As we did when we released Sub-Techniques for ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise, <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/subtechniques/mobile-subtechniques-crosswalk.json">we’re providing a translation table or “crosswalk”</a> from previous release Mobile technique IDs to beta ones to help with the transition. The <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/docs/subtechniques/mobile-subtechniques-crosswalk.json">JSON file</a> shows what happened to each technique in the beta release. The top-level technique ID represents each technique from the v10 release, and the structure underneath shows what changed with the v11 beta release, if anything.</p><p>Thanks to the excellent feedback from the community, we identified four key types of changes:</p><ol><li>Remains Technique</li><li>Became a Sub-Technique</li><li>One or More Techniques Became New Technique</li><li>Deprecated</li></ol><p>Each of these types of changes is represented in the “change-type” field in the JSON. Some of these changes are simpler to implement than others. We recognize this, and in the following steps, we incorporate the four types of changes into tips on how to move from our previous release to ATT&amp;CK with sub-techniques.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rwDx0DyZCuFfyC7CatO32Q.png" /></figure><h4>Step 1: Start with the easy to remap techniques first and automate</h4><p>For “Remains Technique”, “Became a Sub-Technique”, or “One or More Techniques Became New Technique” change types you can replace the previous technique ID with the new technique ID.</p><p>In some cases, technique names have changed, or tactics have been removed, so it’s also worth checking the “explanation” in the JSON.</p><p><strong>Remains Technique</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mN9-SYnxJp7bwPwRb4bSEg.png" /></figure><p>The first thing that’s easy to remap — the techniques that aren’t changing and don’t need to be remapped. Anything labeled “Remains Technique” is still a technique with an unchanged technique ID like T1398 in the above example.</p><p><strong>Became a Sub-Technique</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/785/1*U4O_kLo_D6DYrVSlaIysbA.png" /></figure><p>Next in the “easy to remap category” are the technique to sub-technique transitions, labeled “Became a Sub-Technique”. These techniques were converted into the sub-technique of another technique. In this example, Modify System Partition (T1400) became Hijack Execution Flow: System Runtime API Hijacking (T1625.001).</p><p>Finally, there are a few techniques that merged with other techniques.</p><p><strong>One or More Techniques Became New Technique</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*q0nG7sRGlRByQewj4lpBhA.png" /></figure><p>For techniques labeled “One or More Techniques Became New Technique” a new technique was created covering the scope and content of one or more previous techniques. For example, Network Traffic Capture or Redirection (T1410) and a few other techniques merged together to create Adversary-in-the-Middle (T1638).</p><p>For any of these “easy” types of changes anything represented by the previous ATT&amp;CK technique ID should be transitioned to the new technique or sub-technique ID. The ATT&amp;CK STIX objects represent this type of change as a revoked object which leaves behind a pointer to what they were revoked by. In the case of T1400, that means it was revoked by T1625.001.</p><p>In all of these cases, it’s enough to take what’s listed as the top-level key and replace it with what’s listed in the nested “id” key.</p><h4>Step 2: Look at the deprecated techniques to see what changed</h4><p>This is where some manual effort will take place. Deprecated techniques are not as straightforward.</p><p><strong>Deprecated</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/959/1*WpysMkjdhA09mrYwIEAzfA.png" /></figure><p>For techniques labeled as “Deprecated”, we removed them from ATT&amp;CK without replacing them. They were deprecated because we felt they did not fit into ATT&amp;CK or due to a lack of observed in the wild use. For example, Remotely Wipe Data Without Authorization (T1469) was removed because we hadn’t been able to find evidence of any adversary using it in the wild.</p><h4>Step 3: Review the techniques that have new sub-techniques to see if the new granularity changes how you’d map</h4><p>If you want to take full advantage of sub-techniques, there’s one more step. Many “Remains Technique” techniques now have new sub-techniques you can take advantage of.<br /> <br />One great example of an existing technique that now has new sub-techniques is Application Discovery (T1418). Its name was updated to Software Discovery, and its content was broken out into a new sub-technique: Security Software Discovery (T1418.001).</p><p>The new sub-techniques add more detail and taking advantage of them will require some manual analysis. The good news is that the additional granularity will allow you to represent different types of software discovery that can happen at a more detailed level. These types of remaps can be done over time, because if you keep something mapped to Software Discovery, then it’s still correct. You can map new stuff to the sub-techniques and come back to the old ones to make them more precise as you have time and resources.</p><p>TL;DR, if you do just Step 1 while mapping things that are deprecated to NULL, then it will still be correct. If you do Step 2, then you’ll have pretty much everything you mapped before now also mapped to the new Mobile ATT&amp;CK. If you complete Step 3, then you’ll get the newfound power of sub-techniques!</p><h3>ATT&amp;CK for ICS Joins attack.mitre.org</h3><p>ATT&amp;CK for ICS <a href="https://medium.com/mitre-attack/launching-attack-for-ics-2be4d2fb9b8">launched at the beginning of 2020</a> on a <a href="https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Main_Page">MediaWiki site</a> similar to how attack.mitre.org used to appear. Being on a separate site has let it develop and mature independently while we’ve added it to one ATT&amp;CK resource at a time. Today <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/ics/">we’ve added ATT&amp;CK for ICS to our most visible resource, the ATT&amp;CK website</a> (attack.mitre.org).</p><p>What’s changed? First off, ATT&amp;CK for ICS will no longer have that nostalgic ATT&amp;CK Wiki look and feel, and links to ATT&amp;CK for ICS will need to be updated. Second, we’ve merged the Groups and Software from ICS, adding ICS techniques to Group and Software pages that existed on both sites, and updating descriptions to include both.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vfPGgsdQL7OofPV8jDkl6w.png" /></figure><p>Finally, we’ve merged Data Sources and Data Components in from ATT&amp;CK for ICS. Since there’s quite a bit of overlap between ICS and Enterprise Data Sources we’ve added a filter that allows you to see just Enterprise, just ICS, and all Data Sources and Components on both the overall <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/">Data Sources list</a> and individual Data Source pages.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/1*vKMoYC9fQVqFbJKRcnpu_Q.png" /></figure><p>What hasn’t changed? ATT&amp;CK for ICS’s content hasn’t changed and its STIX <a href="https://github.com/mitre/cti/tree/master/ics-attack">representation remains in the same place</a>. We will also be keeping the previous website in place until October 2022 to avoid breaking your deep links. We will have increasingly dire warnings on each page reminding people to update their links before it is eventually deprecated.

<title>Improving the security of Chrome cookies on Windows</title>
<link>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/improving-security-of-chrome-cookies-on.html</link>
<guid>http://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/improving-security-of-chrome-cookies-on.html</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<span class="byline-author">Posted by Will Harris, Chrome Security Team</span>

<p>
Cybercriminals using cookie theft <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/a-year-in-the-cybersecurity-trenches-with-mandiant-managed-defense">infostealer</a> malware continue to pose a risk to the safety and security of our users. We already have a number of initiatives in this area including <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/07/building-security-into-redesigned.html">Chrome’s download protection</a> using Safe Browsing, <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/04/fighting-cookie-theft-using-device.html">Device Bound Session Credentials</a>, and Google’s account-based threat detection to flag the use of stolen cookies. Today, we’re announcing another layer of protection to make Windows users safer from this type of malware.
</p>
<p>
Like other software that needs to store secrets, Chrome currently secures sensitive data like cookies and passwords using the strongest techniques the OS makes available to us - on macOS this is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/">Keychain services</a>, and on Linux we use a system provided wallet such as kwallet or gnome-libsecret. On Windows, Chrome uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI) which protects the data at rest from other users on the system or cold boot attacks. However, the DPAPI does not protect against malicious applications able to execute code as the logged in user - which infostealers take advantage of.
</p>
<p>
In Chrome 127 we are introducing a new protection on Windows that improves on the DPAPI by providing <strong>Application-Bound (App-Bound) </strong>Encryption primitives. Rather than allowing any app running as the logged in user to access this data, Chrome can now encrypt data tied to app identity, similar to how the Keychain operates on macOS.
</p>
<p>
We will be migrating each type of secret to this new system starting with cookies in Chrome 127. In future releases we intend to expand this protection to passwords, payment data, and other persistent authentication tokens, further protecting users from infostealer malware.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How it works</strong>
</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpjkAClX2VvgsIhLi2zAmvRwVMPEeJqUhqisKHIKxbfGAwh8p8-V7Ixct5azzn_jYfJYo2izWnGcbkVh3cabbCLVQQQsJAJagvFPCFJsx4MibauJqnLVymQYdhdGGc53q3wSJSeTPQ6vyxXosJ-tJRKuaaoV7_J_E2KB9glSZ1m3NSEwEBj-duevgROHlM/s1416/Screenshot%202024-07-26%202.15.06%20PM.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpjkAClX2VvgsIhLi2zAmvRwVMPEeJqUhqisKHIKxbfGAwh8p8-V7Ixct5azzn_jYfJYo2izWnGcbkVh3cabbCLVQQQsJAJagvFPCFJsx4MibauJqnLVymQYdhdGGc53q3wSJSeTPQ6vyxXosJ-tJRKuaaoV7_J_E2KB9glSZ1m3NSEwEBj-duevgROHlM/s16000/Screenshot%202024-07-26%202.15.06%20PM.png" /></a></div><p>
App-Bound Encryption relies on a privileged service to verify the identity of the requesting application. During encryption, the App-Bound Encryption service encodes the app's identity into the encrypted data, and then verifies this is valid when decryption is attempted. If another app on the system tries to decrypt the same data, it will fail.
</p>
<p>
Because the App-Bound service is running with system privileges, attackers need to do more than just coax a user into running a malicious app. Now, the malware has to gain system privileges, or inject code into Chrome, something that legitimate software shouldn't be doing. This makes their actions more suspicious to antivirus software – and more likely to be detected. Our other recent initiatives such as providing <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/detecting-browser-data-theft-using.html">event logs</a> for cookie decryption work in tandem with this protection, with the goal of further increasing the cost and risk of detection to attackers attempting to steal user data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Enterprise Considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>
Since malware can bypass this protection by running elevated, enterprise environments that do not grant their users the ability to run downloaded files as Administrator are particularly helped by this protection - malware cannot simply request elevation privilege in these environments and is forced to use techniques such as injection that can be more easily detected by endpoint agents.
</p>
<p>
App-Bound Encryption strongly binds the encryption key to the machine, so will not function correctly in environments where Chrome profiles roam between multiple machines. We encourage enterprises who wish to support roaming profiles to follow current <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7349337">best practices</a>. If it becomes necessary, App-Bound encryption can be configured using the new <a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#ApplicationBoundEncryptionEnabled">ApplicationBoundEncryptionEnabled</a> policy.
</p>
<p>
To further help detect any incompatibilities, Chrome emits an event when a failed verification occurs. The Event is ID 257 from 'Chrome' source in the Application log.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
App-Bound Encryption increases the cost of data theft to attackers and also makes their actions far noisier on the system. It helps defenders draw a clear line in the sand for what is acceptable behavior for other apps on the system. As the malware landscape continually evolves we are keen to continue engaging with others in the security community on improving detections and strengthening operating system protections, such as stronger app isolation primitives, for any bypasses.

<p>
<em><b>Update (07/22/2024): </b>Website operators who will be impacted by the upcoming change in Chrome for new TLS certificates issued after October 31, 2024 can explore continuity options offered by Entrust. Entrust has expressed its commitment to continuing to support customer needs, and is best positioned to describe the available options for website operators. Learn more at Entrust’s <a href="https://www.entrust.com/tls-certificate-information-center">TLS Certificate Information Center</a>.</em>
</p>

    

<p>
The Chrome Security Team prioritizes the security and privacy of Chrome’s users, and we are unwilling to compromise on these values.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/">Chrome Root Program Policy</a> states that CA certificates included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a> must provide value to Chrome end users that exceeds the risk of their continued inclusion. It also describes many of the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/#7-reporting-and-responding-to-incidents">factors</a> we consider significant when CA Owners disclose and respond to incidents. When things don’t go right, we expect CA Owners to commit to meaningful and demonstrable change resulting in evidenced continuous improvement.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past several years, publicly disclosed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?o2=greaterthaneq&amp;short_desc_type=casesubstring&amp;o1=notequals&amp;v1=Graveyard&amp;classification=Client%20Software&amp;classification=Developer%20Infrastructure&amp;classification=Components&amp;classification=Server%20Software&amp;classification=Other&amp;classification=Graveyard&amp;v2=2015-11-01&amp;f1=classification&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED&amp;short_desc=Entrust&amp;f2=creation_ts&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;list_id=17064895">incident reports</a> highlighted a pattern of concerning behaviors by Entrust that fall short of the above expectations, and has eroded confidence in their competence, reliability, and integrity as a publicly-trusted CA Owner. 
</p>
<p>
In response to the above concerns and to preserve the integrity of the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/how-chrome-root-program-keeps-users-safe.html#:~:text=Chrome%20uses%20digital,the%20%E2%80%9CWeb%20PKI.%E2%80%9D">Web PKI</a> ecosystem, Chrome will take the following actions.

</p>
<p>
To further minimize risk of disruption, website operators are encouraged to review the “Frequently Asked Questions" listed below.
</p>
<h3><strong>Why is Chrome taking action?</strong></h3>


<p>
Certification Authorities (CAs) serve a privileged and trusted role on the Internet that underpin encrypted connections between browsers and websites. With this tremendous responsibility comes an expectation of adhering to reasonable and consensus-driven security and compliance expectations, including those defined by the CA/Browser TLS Baseline Requirements.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past six years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports. When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the Internet ecosystem, it is our opinion that Chrome’s continued trust in Entrust is no longer justified. 
</p>
<h3><strong>When will this action happen?</strong></h3>


<p>
Blocking action will begin on approximately November 1, 2024, affecting certificates issued at that point or later.
</p>
<p>
Blocking action will occur in Versions of <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule">Chrome 127</a> and greater on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Android, and Linux. Apple policies prevent the Chrome Certificate Verifier and corresponding Chrome Root Store from being used on Chrome for iOS.
</p>
<h3><strong>What is the user impact of this action?</strong></h3>


<p>
By default, Chrome users in the above populations who navigate to a website serving a certificate issued by Entrust or AffirmTrust after October 31, 2024 will see a full page interstitial <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/">similar to this one</a>.
</p>
<p>
Certificates issued by other CAs are not impacted by this action.
</p>
<h3><strong>How can a website operator tell if their website is affected?</strong></h3>


<p>
Website operators can determine if they are affected by this issue by using the Chrome Certificate Viewer.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use the Chrome Certificate Viewer</span>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Navigate to a website (e.g., <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>)

</li><li>Click the “Tune" icon

</li><li>Click “Connection is Secure" 

</li><li>Click “Certificate is Valid" (the Chrome Certificate Viewer will open) 
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Website owner action is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span> contain “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
 
</li><li><strong>Website owner action is required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading contains “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
</ul>
<h3><strong>What does an affected website operator do?</strong></h3>


<p>
We recommend that affected website operators transition to a new publicly-trusted CA Owner as soon as reasonably possible. To avoid adverse website user impact, action <strong>must</strong> be completed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the existing certificate(s) expire if expiry is planned to take place <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> October 31, 2024. 
</p>
<p>
While website operators could delay the impact of blocking action by choosing to collect and install a new TLS certificate issued from Entrust before Chrome’s blocking action begins on November 1, 2024, website operators will inevitably need to collect and install a new TLS certificate from one of the many other CAs included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a>.
</p>
<h3><strong>Can I test these changes before they take effect?</strong></h3>


<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p>
A command-line flag was added beginning in Chrome 128 (available in Canary/Dev at the time of this post’s publication) that allows administrators and power users to simulate the effect of an SCTNotAfter distrust constraint as described in this blog post FAQ.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to: Simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust</span></p><p>1. Close all open versions of Chrome</p><p>2. Start Chrome using the following command-line flag, substituting variables described below with actual values</p>

<div class="code">
--test-crs-constraints=$[Comma Separated List of Trust Anchor Certificate SHA256 Hashes]:sctnotafter=$[epoch_timestamp]
</div><p>

</p><p>3. Evaluate the effects of the flag with test websites&nbsp;</p><p><b>Example:</b>&nbsp;The following command will simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust with an effective date of April 30, 2024 11:59:59 PM GMT for all of the Entrust trust anchors included in the Chrome Root Store. The expected behavior is that any website whose certificate is issued before the enforcement date/timestamp will function in Chrome, and all issued after will display an interstitial.</p><p>

<title>The May 2024 Security Update Review</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/5/14/the-may-2024-security-update-review</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/5/14/the-may-2024-security-update-review</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="">Welcome to the second Tuesday of May. As expected, Adobe and Microsoft have released their standard bunch of security patches. Take a break from your regular activities and join us as we review the details of their latest advisories. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>





















  
  






  <p class=""><strong>Apple Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">Apple kicked off the May release cycle with a group of updates for their macOS and iOS platforms. Most notable is a fix for CVE-2024-23296 for <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214100" target="_blank">iOS 16.7.8 and iPadOS 16.7.8</a>. This vulnerability is a memory corruption issue in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMawXNtXrQ">RTKit</a> that could allow attackers to bypass kernel memory protections. The initial patch was released back in March, but Apple noted additional fixes would be coming, and here they are. This bug is reported as being under active attack, so if you’re using a device with an affected OS, make sure you get the update.</p><p class="">Apple also patched the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214103" target="_blank">Safari</a> bug demonstrated at Pwn2Own Vancouver by Master of Pwn Winner Manfred Paul.</p><p class=""><strong>Adobe Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">For May, Adobe released eight patches addressing 37 CVEs in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, Illustrator, Substance3D Painter, Adobe Aero, Substance3D Designer, Adobe Animate, FrameMaker, and Dreamweaver. Eight of these vulnerabilities were reported through the ZDI program. The update for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb24-29.html" target="_blank">Reader</a> should be the priority. It includes multiple Critical-rated bugs that are often used by malware and ransomware gangs. While none of these bugs are under active attack, it is likely some will eventually be exploited. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb24-30.html">Illustrator</a> also addresses a couple of Critical-rated bugs that could result in arbitrary code execution. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/aero/apsb24-33.html" target="_blank">Aero</a> (an augmented reality authoring and publishing tool) fixes a single code execution bug. Unless I’m mistaken, this is the first Adobe patch for this product.</p><p class="">The fix for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/animate/apsb24-36.html" target="_blank">Adobe Animate</a> fixes eight bugs, seven of which result in Critical-rated code execution. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/framemaker/apsb24-37.html">FrameMaker</a> also fixes several code execution bugs. These are classic open-and-own bugs that require user interaction. That’s the same for the single bug fixed in <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/dreamweaver/apsb24-39.html">Dreamweaver</a>. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/substance3d_painter/apsb24-31.html">Substance 3D Painter</a> addresses four bugs, two of which are rated Critical, while the patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/substance3d_designer/apsb24-35.html">Substance 3D Designer</a> fixes a single Important-rated memory leak.</p><p class="">None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3.</p><p class=""><strong>Microsoft Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">This month, Microsoft released 59 CVEs in Windows and Windows Components; Office and Office Components; .NET Framework and Visual Studio; Microsoft Dynamics 365; Power BI; DHCP Server; Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based); and Windows Mobile Broadband. If you include the third-party CVEs being documented this month, the CVE count comes to 63. A total of two of these bugs came through the ZDI program. As with last month, none of the bugs disclosed at Pwn2Own Vancouver are fixed with this release. With Apple and <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24280">VMware</a> fixing the vulnerabilities reported during the event, Microsoft stands alone as the only vendor not to produce patches from the contest.</p><p class="">Of the new patches released today, only one is rated Critical, 57 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. This release is roughly a third of the size of last month’s, so hopefully that’s a sign that a huge number of fixes in a single month isn’t going to be a regular occurrence.</p><p class="">Two of the CVEs released today are listed as under active attack, and one other is listed as publicly known at the time of the release. Microsoft doesn’t provide any indication of the volume of attacks, but the DWM Core bug appears to me to be more than a targeted attack. Let’s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with the DWM bug currently exploited in the wild:</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30051" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30051</strong></a><strong> – Windows DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br /></strong>This bug allows attackers to escalate the SYSTEM on affected systems. These types of bugs are usually combined with a code execution bug to take over a target and are often used by ransomware. Microsoft credits four different groups for reporting the bug, which indicates the attacks are widespread. They also indicate the vulnerability is publicly known. Don’t wait to test and deploy this update as exploits are likely to increase now that a patch is available to reverse engineer.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30043" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30043</strong></a><strong> – Microsoft SharePoint Server Information Disclosure Vulnerability<br /></strong>This vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by ZDI researcher Piotr Bazydło and represents an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019. An authenticated attacker could use this bug to read local files with SharePoint Farm service account user privileges. They could also perform an HTTP-based server-side request forgery (SSRF), and – most importantly – perform NLTM relaying as the SharePoint Farm service account. Bugs like this show why info disclosure vulnerabilities shouldn’t be ignored or deprioritized.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30033" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30033</strong></a><strong> – Windows Search Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is another bug reported through the ZDI program and has a similar impact to the bug currently being exploited, although it manifests through a different mechanism. This is a link following bug in the Windows Search service. By creating a pseudo-symlink, an attacker could redirect a delete call to delete a different file or folder as SYSTEM. We discussed how this could be used to elevate privileges <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/3/16/abusing-arbitrary-file-deletes-to-escalate-privilege-and-other-great-tricks" target="_blank">here</a>. The delete happens when restarting the service. A low-privileged user can't restart the service directly. However, this could easily be combined with a bug that allows a low-privileged user to terminate any process by PID. After failure, the service will restart automatically, successfully triggering this vulnerability.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30050" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30050</strong></a><strong> – Windows Mark of the Web Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability<br /></strong>We don’t normally detail Moderate-rated bugs, but this type of security feature bypass is quite in vogue with ransomware gangs right now. They zip their payload to bypass network and host-based defenses, they use a Mark of the Web (MotW) bypass to evade SmartScreen or Protected View in Microsoft Office. While we have no indication this bug is being actively used, we see the technique used often enough to call it out. Bugs like this one show why Moderate-rated bugs shouldn’t be ignored or deprioritized.</p><p class="">Here’s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for May 2024:</p>

  <p class=""><em>* Indicates this CVE had been released by a third party and is now being included in Microsoft releases</em>.</p><p class=""><em>† Indicates further administrative actions are required to fully address the vulnerability.</em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">There’s just one Critical-rated bug this month, and it deals with a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could use this bug to execute arbitrary code in the context of the SharePoint Server. While permissions are needed for this to occur, any authorized user on the server has the needed level of permissions.</p><p class="">Looking at the other RCE bugs, we see a lot of vulnerabilities in rarely used protocols. The Windows Mobile Broadband driver and the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) make up the bulk of this category. More notable are the two bugs in Hyper-V. One of these would allow an authenticated attacker to execute code on the host system. This would result in a guest-to-host escape, but Microsoft doesn’t indicate what level the code execution occurs on the host OS. After a couple of months with many SQL-related fixes, there’s just one this month. As with the previous bugs, you would need to connect to a malicious SQL server. The bug in Cryptographic Services requires a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) but could lead to a malicious certificate being imported onto the target system. The RCE bugs are rounded out with open-and-own style bugs in Excel and .NET and Visual Studio.</p><p class="">Moving on to the elevation of privilege (EoP) patches in this month’s release, almost all lead to SYSTEM-level code execution if an authenticated user runs specially crafted code. While there isn’t a lot else to say about these bugs, they are often used by attackers to take over a system when combined with a code execution bug – like the Excel bug mentioned above. They convince a user to open a specially crafted Excel document that executes the EoP and takes over the system. The lone exception to this is the bug in the Brokering File System component. The vulnerability allows attackers to gain the ability to authenticate against a remote host using the current user’s credentials. The attack could be launched from a low-privileged AppContainer, which would allow the attacker to execute code or access resources at a higher integrity level than that of the AppContainer execution environment.</p><p class="">We’ve already discussed the MotW security feature bypass (SFB), and the only other SFB vulnerability receiving a fix this month is the MSHTML engine. Just when you thought you were safe from Internet Explorer, the Trident engine rears its ugly head. This bug allows an unauthenticated attacker to get code execution if they can convince a user to open a malicious document. The code execution occurs in the context of the user, so this is another reminder not to log on with Admin privileges unless you absolutely need to.</p><p class="">There are only seven information disclosure bugs receiving fixes this month, and we’ve already covered the one in SharePoint. As usual, most of these vulnerabilities only result in info leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. The bug in Power BI could result in the disclosing of “sensitive information,” but Microsoft doesn’t narrow down what type of “sensitive information” could be leaked. Similarly, the bug in Deployment Services could leak “file contents.” Microsoft provides no information on whether that’s any arbitrary file contents or only specific files, so your guess is as good as mine.</p><p class="">The May release includes four spoofing bugs. The first is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bug in Azure Migrate. There’s not a straightforward patch for this one. You need the latest Azure Migrate Agent and ConfigManager updates. More info on how to do that can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/common-questions-appliance#how-to-troubleshoot-auto-update-failures-for-azure-migrate-appliance.">here</a>. There are two spoofing bugs in Dynamics 365, but they read more like XSS bugs. The final spoofing bug addressed this month is in the Bing search engine. An attacker could modify the content of the vulnerable link to redirect the victim to a malicious site.</p><p class="">There’s a single Tampering bug addressed in this release fixing a bug in Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management. An attacker could gain sensitive information on a target device that has been rooted.</p><p class="">The final bugs for May are Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities in ASP.NET, DHCP server, and Hyper-V. Unfortunately, Microsoft provides no additional information about these bugs and how they would manifest on affected systems.</p><p class="">There are no new advisories in this month’s release.</p><p class=""><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p class="">The next Patch Tuesday of 2024 will be on June 11, and I’ll return with details and patch analysis then. Until then, stay safe, happy patching, and may all your reboots be smooth and clean!</p>

<title>The April 2024 Security Updates Review</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/4/9/the-april-2024-security-updates-review</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/4/9/the-april-2024-security-updates-review</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="">It’s the second Tuesday of the month, and Adobe and Microsoft have released a fresh crop of security updates. Take a break from your other activities and join us as we review the details of their latest advisories. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>





















  
  






  <p class=""><strong>Adobe Patches for April 2024</strong></p><p class="">For April, Adobe released nine patches addressing 24 CVEs in Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Commerce, InDesign, Experience Manager, Media Encoder, Bridge, Illustrator, and Adobe Animate. The largest of these updates is for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb24-21.html">Experience Manager</a>, however, all of the bugs being patched are simple Cross-site Scripting (XSS) bugs. Still, if exploited, these Important-severity bugs could lead to code execution if exploited. The only other patches that address multiple CVEs are the fixes for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/animate/apsb24-26.html">Animate</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb24-18.html">Commerce</a>. The patch for Animate addresses four bugs. Two of these are rated Critical and could lead to arbitrary code execution. The patch for Commerce also fixes two Critical-rated bugs, one XSS and one improper input validation bug. Both could lead to code execution. </p><p class="">Then we have several patches that are all info leaks due to an Out-Of-Bounds (OOB) read. These were all reported by the same person, and it makes me wonder if there is shared code between these products that makes them all vulnerable. In any case, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/after_effects/apsb24-09.html">After Effects</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/photoshop/apsb24-16.html">Photoshop</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/indesign/apsb24-20.html">InDesign</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/bridge/apsb24-24.html">Bridge</a>, and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb24-25.html">Illustrator</a> all fall into this category. That just leaves the update for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/media-encoder/apsb24-23.html">Media Encoder</a>. This patch fixes a single buffer overflow that could lead to code execution.</p><p class="">None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3.</p><p class=""><strong>Microsoft Patches for April 2024</strong></p><p class="">This month, Microsoft released a whopping 147 new CVEs in Microsoft Windows and Windows Components; Office and Office Components; Azure; .NET Framework and Visual Studio; SQL Server; DNS Server; Windows Defender; Bitlocker; and Windows Secure Boot. If you include the third-party CVEs being documented this month, the CVE count comes to 155. A total of three of these bugs came through the ZDI program. None of the bugs disclosed at Pwn2Own Vancouver are fixed with this release.</p><p class="">Of the new patches released today, only three are rated Critical, 142 are rated Important, and two are rated Moderate in severity. This is the largest release from Microsoft this year and the largest since at least 2017. As far as I can tell, it’s the largest Patch Tuesday release from Microsoft of all time. It’s not clear if this is due to a backlog from the slower months or a surge in vulnerability reporting. It will be interesting to see which trend continues.</p><p class="">None of the CVEs released today are listed as currently under active attack and none are listed as publicly known at the time of release. However, the bug reported by ZDI threat hunter Peter Girnus was found in the wild. We have evidence this is being exploited in the wild, and I’m listing it as such.</p><p class="">Let’s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with a bug we consider to be currently exploited in the wild:</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29988"><strong>CVE-2024-29988</strong></a><strong> – SmartScreen Prompt Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is an odd one, as a ZDI threat researcher found this vulnerability being in the wild, although Microsoft currently doesn’t list this as exploited. I would treat this as in the wild until Microsoft clarifies. The bug itself acts much like <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/b/cve202421412-water-hydra-targets-traders-with-windows-defender-s.html">CVE-2024-21412</a> – it bypasses the Mark of the Web (MotW) feature and allows malware to execute on a target system. Threat actors are sending exploits in a zipped file to evade EDR/NDR detection and then using this bug (and others) to bypass MotW. </p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-20678"><strong>CVE-2024-20678</strong></a><strong> – Remote Procedure Call Runtime Remote Code Execution Vulnerability<br /></strong>There is a long history of RPC exploits being seen in the wild, so any RPC bug that could lead to code execution turns heads. This bug does require authentication, but it doesn’t require any elevated permission. Any authenticated user could hit it. It’s not clear if you could hit this if you authenticated as Guest or an anonymous user. A quick search shows about 1.3 million systems with TCP port 135 exposed to the internet. I expect a lot of people will be looking to exploit this in short order.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-20670"><strong>CVE-2024-20670</strong></a><strong> – Outlook for Windows Spoofing Vulnerability<br /></strong>This bug is listed as a spoofing bug, but based on the end result of exploitation, I would consider this information disclosure. In this case, the information disclosed would be NTLM hashes, which could then be used for Spoofing targeted users. Either way, a user would need to click something in an email to trigger this vulnerability. The Preview Pane is NOT an attack vector. However, we have seen a rash of NTLM relaying bugs over the last few months. With the wide user base of Outlook, this will likely be targeted by threat actors in the coming months.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-26221"><strong>CVE-2024-26221</strong></a><strong> – Windows DNS Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is one of seven DNS RCE bugs being patched this month and all are documented identically. These bugs allow RCE on an affected DNS server if the attacker has the privileges to query the DNS server. There is a timing factor here as well, but if the DNS queries are timed correctly, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target server. Although not specifically stated, it seems logical that the code execution would occur at the level of the DNS service, which is elevated. I really don’t need to tell you that your DNS servers are critical targets, so please take these bugs seriously and test and deploy the patches quickly.</p><p class="">Here’s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for April 2024:</p><p class=""><em>*Note that post-release, Microsoft confirmed CVE-2024-26234 is also under active attack. The table has been updated to reflect this new information</em></p>

  <p class=""><em>* Indicates this CVE had been released by a third party and is now being included in Microsoft releases</em>.</p><p class=""><em>† Indicates further administrative actions are required to fully address the vulnerability.</em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Moving on to the Critical-rated bugs, all impact Microsoft Defender for IoT. An authenticated attacker with file upload privileges could get arbitrary code execution through a path traversal vulnerability. They would need to upload specially crafted files to sensitive locations on the target. It’s not clear how likely this would be, but anything that targets your defensive tools should be taken seriously.</p><p class="">All told, there are almost 70 fixes for bugs that could lead to code execution in this release. The (somewhat) good news is that nearly half of these impact SQL server components. In these cases, an attacker would need to have an affected system connect to a specially crafted SQL database and perform a query. If you can socially engineer that, then you will get code execution. However, that does seem unlikely. More practically, I would concern myself with the DNS and DHCP code execution bugs in this release. I’ve already mentioned the DNS bugs. For the DHCP bugs, the attacker would need elevated privileges. This would be a good time to audit your DHCP server to see who has privileges and who should be removed. The fix for Azure Migrate is only network adjacent, but you’ll need to take extra steps to be fully protected. You need to the latest Azure Migrate Appliance's AutoUpdater, which ensures MSI installers downloaded from the Download Center have been authentically signed by Microsoft prior to installation. Check <a href="Azure%20Migrate%20Appliance's%20AutoUpdater%20which%20ensures%20MSI%20installers%20downloaded%20from%20the%20Download%20Center%20have%20been%20authentically%20signed%20by%20Microsoft%20prior%20to%20installation.">here</a> for more details. There is an update for Excel to address an open-an-own bug, but you’re out of luck if you’re on macOS. Updates for Apple users are not available yet. </p><p class="">There’s a mountain of elevation of privilege (EoP) patches in this month’s release, and in most cases, exploitation requires an attacker to log on the an affected system then run their code. Again, this usually results in getting code to elevate to SYSTEM. The Azure EoPs are a little bit different and require some extra steps. The bug in Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information, such as Azure IoT Operations secrets and potentially other credentials or access tokens stored within the Kubernetes cluster. You’ll also need to update any affected Extensions that are used in your environment and ensure you update your Azure Arc Agent. The bug in Azure Content Gallery also needs extra actions to be protected. This bug has been mitigated by the latest change to the Azure Compute Gallery (ACG) image creation permission requirements, which means you’ll need to check the permissions and possibly update them. For information on how to update permissions, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries?tabs=vhdsource%2Cazure-cli#what-rbac-permissions-are-required-to-create-an-acg-image">here</a> for details. For the Azure Monitor Agent EoP, you need to make sure you have Automatic Extension Upgrades enabled. If you don’t you can manually get the updates following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage?tabs=azure-portal#update">these</a> instructions. Finally, the bug in the Azure Kubernetes Service also needs some extra work. To be fully protected, you need to ensure you are running the latest version of “az confcom” and Kata Image. If you don’t have “az conform” installed, you can get the latest version by running the command “az extension add -n conform”. See the bulletin for full details.</p><p class="">Moving on to the security feature bypass (SFB) bugs, how in the world are there 23 different SFB patches for Secure Boot? As if that isn’t enough, you’ll need to take additional steps to be protected. The patch fixes the bugs, but the protections aren’t enabled by default. You’ll need to check out this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5025885">KB article</a> and follow the instructions listed there. With 23 bugs and manual actions needed to address them, I don’t think we should call it “secure” boot anymore. Other SFB bugs include one that could bypass RSA signature verification and a bug in BitLocker that could also bypass secure boot. At least that one just requires a patch and no extra steps.</p><p class="">There are more than a dozen information disclosure bugs. Fortunately, most only result in info leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. The bug in Azure AI Search could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive API Keys. While this bug has been mitigated by a recent update to Azure AI Search's backend infrastructure, you’ll need to manually rotate specific credentials that have been notified through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/overview">Azure Service Health</a> alerts. The bug in Azure Identity Library for .NET could divulge data inside the targeted website like IDs, tokens, nonces, and other sensitive information. At least there are no additional steps beyond the patch for this one. Finally, the bug in Windows DFS could disclose the ever-descriptive “sensitive information”.</p><p class="">The April release is rounded out by a handful of spoofing and denial-of-service (DoS) bugs. Microsoft doesn’t provide a lot of useful information here, but if you need to focus on something, the DoS bugs in the DHCP service are where I’d start. Shutting down DHCP for any time in an enterprise will likely lead to a “no fun at all” day.</p><p class="">Finally, Microsoft has updated <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/advisory/ADV990001">ADV99001</a> with the latest servicing stack updates. Be sure to check them out. </p><p class=""><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p class="">The next Patch Tuesday of 2024 will be on May 14, and I’ll return with details and patch analysis then. Until then, stay safe, happy patching, and may all your reboots be smooth and clean!</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Threat actors (TAs) predominantly rely on phishing websites as a method to distribute malware. A key tactic involves impersonating well-known brands, especially those associated with essential or security-related applications, to enhance the credibility of their campaigns. They create a false sense of legitimacy by showcasing compatibility with various platforms and mimicking trusted applications. This deceptive approach exploits users' trust in familiar brands, making it easier for TAs to trick unsuspecting individuals into downloading malicious software. The sophisticated blend of brand impersonation and the appearance of security further reinforces the illusion of authenticity, increasing the chances of successful infiltration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Recently, CRIL has identified a phishing website aimed at individuals downloading VPN applications for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The TA has created separate stealer binaries for each operating system, using a deceptive site that mimics the legitimate "WarpVPN" service. This phishing site offers detailed installation instructions specific to each platform. Once installed, the stealer extracts various sensitive data from the victim’s machine. It targets cryptocurrency-related browser extensions, standalone crypto wallets, stored browser passwords, browser login data, cookies, SSH keys, macOS passwords, and Keychain. The below image shows the phishing website.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spreading Mechanism&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>During our investigation, we discovered a Telegram channel linked to this campaign. The phishing website associated with the campaign is referenced in the channel's bio. This channel has over 54,000 subscribers and plays a crucial role in the distribution of malicious content. The figure below displays the Telegram channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Figure </em><em>2</em><em> - Telegram Channel</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Upon further investigation, we found that this channel has been active since at least 2018, with several profile changes over time, as shown in the figure below. Notably, the phishing site was added to its bio in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The phishing site has switched registrars’ multiple times, with the most recent change occurring on August 21, 2024. We suspect that the TAs initially provided legitimate services and are now taking advantage of the trust they've built to distribute stealer <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/">malware</a>. Posts from 2021 indicate that the TAs offered free VPN services individually, as illustrated in the figure below, further supporting this claim. </p>

<p>We also observed that a Russian native speaker likely wrote posts made before 2021, while posts from 2021 appear to be auto-translated versions, as shown in the figure below. Interestingly, the phishing domain was also added to the channel's bio in 2021, suggesting that the operator of the Telegram channel may have changed during that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, in 2021, the channel's profile photo was updated to an image taken by a Russian YouTuber, as shown in the figure below. Moreover, upon investigating the contact person mentioned in the channel, we discovered that they have a history of frequent interactions with Arabic speakers. This further suggests that the channel's operator might be from a different origin, attempting to pose as a Russian individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Technical Analysis&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this campaign, the TAs set up a phishing site that impersonates a legitimate VPN service, offering detailed installation instructions for Windows, Linux, and macOS.&nbsp; The initial infection occurs when users follow the phishing site’s instructions, which involve copying and pasting platform-specific commands into their systems. Each set of commands—tailored for Windows, macOS, and Linux—ensures the malicious code is executed correctly on the respective operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this section, we will examine how TA steals sensitive information across different platforms, focusing on both common techniques and platform-specific approaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Windows&nbsp;</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Windows, the TA utilizes PowerShell commands to carry out the attack. They use ‘<em>Invoke-WebRequest</em>’ to download the “<em>install.bat</em>” file from "hxxps://warpvpn[.]net". Following the download, ‘<em>Start-Process</em>’ command is used to launch a new instance of ‘<em>cmd.exe’</em>, passing ‘<em>install.bat</em>’ as an argument to execute the batch file. This method ensures the ‘install.bat’ script is run seamlessly as part of the attack. As shown in the image below, the TA instructs users to copy and paste commands intended for PowerShell into the Command Prompt. These commands will not work properly in the Command Prompt and will only execute correctly within a PowerShell environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The malicious python package “<em>hclockify-win</em>” contains scripts to orchestrate sensitive information collection and exfiltration by calling various modules. These modules target cryptocurrency browser extensions, Crypto Wallets, and Stored Browser passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Targeting Browser Extensions</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Python package "<em>hclockify-win</em>" includes a module named "<em>ganache.helperwd</em>" that scans multiple Chromium-based browsers, including Chrome, Brave, Opera, and Microsoft Edge, for cryptocurrency wallet extensions such as Trust Wallet, TronLink, Coinbase, Exodus, Crypto.com, Nami, and Solana. Once these extensions are detected, the module compresses their folders into a zip file and sends the data to the TAs command and control (C&amp;C) server through a POST request, as illustrated in the figure below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":56943,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="Targets Browser Extension " class="wp-image-56943" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-10-–-Targets-Browser-Extension.png" /></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} --></p>
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Figure </em><em>10</em><em> - Targets Browser Extension</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By targeting these extensions, the TAs aim to steal cryptocurrency wallet data, including private keys, recovery phrases, and transaction details. This could potentially allow the TAs to gain unauthorized access to the victim's digital assets. The stolen information can be further exploited or sold on cybercrime forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After scanning multiple browsers for cryptocurrency wallet extensions, the module proceeds to search through all Firefox profiles. It targets the <em>prefs.js</em> file to identify the unique ID linked to MetaMask by searching for <em>webextension@metamask.io</em>. Once the unique ID is identified, the module uses it to locate MetaMask’s backend data file present in the location “<em>b0kwoimz.default-release\storage\default\moz-extension+++7f784e52-eabb-4316-8e36-850ac47f0760^userContextId=4294967295”.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The script then compresses this data into a zip file and transmits it to the TAs server via a POST request, maintaining the continuity of the data exfiltration process.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Targeting Crypto Wallets</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The malicious Python module then searches for cryptocurrency wallets installed on the system, identifying the installation directories for well-known crypto wallets such as Bitcoin, Monero, and Dashcore. After locating these directories, the content of these wallets is compressed into a zip file and subsequently uploaded to the TAs command and control (C&amp;C) server through a POST request, as shown in the figure below.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Targeting Browser passwords</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Additionally, the malicious Python module targets browser passwords stored in an SQLite database called "<em>Login Data." </em>For Chromium-based browsers, the script first enumerates and retrieves the names of all files within the “<em>Browser-name\User Data\</em>” directory. It specifically looks for the "<em>Local State</em>" file, which holds the encrypted key necessary for decryption. The script then utilizes the “<em>CryptUnprotectData()”&nbsp;</em> function to decrypt this key. With the decrypted key, the script can subsequently decrypt the "Login Data" file, which contains all user credentials. This process allows the attackers to access and exfiltrate saved passwords from the targeted browsers.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For non-Chromium-based browsers like Firefox, the TA employs a module called “<em>ganache.fflg</em>” which is capable of extracting credentials across different platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac. In our scenario, the focus is on Windows. The module systematically iterates through all Firefox profiles to collect key files such as “<em>prefs.js</em>”,<em> “logins.json”</em>, and, as a fallback for older versions, “<em>signons.sqlite</em>”. It then leverages the <em>Network Security Services</em> (NSS) library <em>nss3.dll</em> to decrypt and extract the browser credentials in plain text. Once decrypted, the decrypted credentials are exfiltrated from the victim's machine to the TAs command and control (C&amp;C) server.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The script “<em>install-linux.sh</em>” first attempts to retrieve a unique ID from the &nbsp;<br />“<em>warpvpn</em>” configuration file located at “~/HOME/.config/warpvpn”. If this file is missing, the script sends a POST request to the server containing the victim’s username, operating system, and the phishing source in order to obtain a unique ID. This ID is then used in all subsequent POST requests, along with the stolen data from the victim's machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The “<em>install-linux.sh” </em>script is divided into two main components: a stealer that gathers sensitive browser information and a cryptocurrency stealer, along with a function designed to mimic the legitimate Cloudflare Warp application installer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This Linux module mirrors the Python-based stealing activities observed on Windows systems, targeting browser extensions and cryptocurrency wallets, including Bitcoin and Monero. However, on Linux, the script introduces some notable variations. The bash script is designed to steal Login Data and Cookies files from the victim’s machine and exfiltrate them to C&amp;C server. Furthermore, the script searches for and uploads SSH keys from the “<em>/.ssh</em>” folder, as depicted in the figure below. This comprehensive approach significantly boosts the attacker's ability to gain and maintain unauthorized access to the compromised system.&nbsp;</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Targeting MacOS password:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The script tricks the user into entering their credentials by mimicking a standard system prompt that typically appears during a new application installation, making it appear as a legitimate request. After the user enters their password, the script uses the ‘<em>dscl . -authonly</em>’ command to validate the credentials. If the validation is successful and no errors occur, the credentials, along with data from the “<em>/Library/Keychains</em>” folder, are sent to the attacker's command and control (C&amp;C) server through a ‘curl’ POST request. If the validation fails, the script repeatedly prompts the user to re-enter their credentials, continuing this process until it succeeds.&nbsp;</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The TA aimed to gather information similar to what was observed in previous Linux cases. However, there are notable differences in the scope of the attack. In addition to targeting common cryptocurrency wallets like Bitcoin and Monero, the TA also focuses on a broader range of crypto wallets, including Electrum, Exodus, DashCore, and Guarda. Furthermore, the script searches for and exfiltrates saved SSH keys from the `/.ssh` folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the theft operation, the TA employs a deceptive tactic by displaying a fake “in-progress” message.After successfully exfiltrating the data, the script proceeds to download and install the genuine Cloudflare Warp application on the victim's machine, as shown in the figure below.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exfiltration over HTTPS&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before the exfiltration process, the TA archives the stolen files into ZIP files, ensuring they are organized by data type with distinct archive names for each category. These archives are then transmitted to the attacker's Command and Control (C&amp;C) server via a POST request to “<em>hxxps://ganache.live/api/v1/attachment</em>”. The communication occurs over port 443, allowing the data to be sent securely under the guise of legitimate HTTPS traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This phishing campaign masquerades as a trustworthy VPN provider. This campaign is spreading from a Telegram channel, carefully cultivating user confidence over time before pivoting to malicious objectives. This Telegram channel boasts over 54,000 subscribers, which has been operational since 2018 and is believed to have undergone a change in operators in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The campaign’s reach is underscored by its targeting of multiple platforms—Windows, Linux, and macOS—demonstrating a comprehensive approach to malware distribution. By creating distinct malicious scripts tailored for each operating system, the attackers ensure that their payloads are effectively executed across different environments. This multi-platform strategy allows the phishing operation to maximize its reach and impact, compromising a wide array of systems and harvesting sensitive information from a diverse user base.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
