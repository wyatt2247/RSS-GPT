<p>Not long ago, the ability to digitally track someone’s daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a dangerous power that should remain only within the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69282" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69282" height="756" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69282">Image: Shutterstock, Arthimides.</p></div>
<p>Delaware-based<strong> Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</strong> helps its users remove their personal information from the clutches of consumer data brokers, and from <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=people+search" rel="noopener" target="_blank">people-search services online</a>. Backed by millions of dollars in litigation financing, Atlas so far this year has sued 151 consumer data brokers on behalf of a class that includes more than 20,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers who are signed up for Atlas services.</p>
<p>Atlas alleges all of these data brokers have ignored repeated warnings that they are violating <strong>Daniel’s Law</strong>, a New Jersey statute allowing law enforcement, government personnel, judges and their families to have their information completely removed from commercial data brokers. Daniel’s Law was passed in 2020 after the death of 20-year-old <strong>Daniel Anderl</strong>, who was killed in a violent attack targeting a federal judge &#8212; his mother.</p>
<p>Last week, Atlas invoked Daniel&#8217;s Law in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.18_Babel_Street_Compl_w_Summons-Case_Info_-_4874-8628-4017_-_1__1_.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a> (PDF) against <strong>Babel Street</strong>, a little-known technology company incorporated in Reston, Va. Babel Street&#8217;s core product allows customers to draw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slighted dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area.</p>
<p>Babel Street’s <strong>LocateX</strong> platform also allows customers to track individual mobile users by their <strong>Mobile Advertising ID</strong> or <strong>MAID</strong>, a unique, alphanumeric identifier built into all Google Android and Apple mobile devices.</p>
<p>Babel Street can offer this tracking capability by consuming location data and other identifying information that is collected by many websites and broadcast to dozens and sometimes hundreds of ad networks that may wish to bid on showing their ad to a particular user.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69280" style="width: 1458px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69280" height="990" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque.jpeg" width="1448" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69280">This image, taken from a video recording Atlas made of its private investigator using Babel Street to show all of the unique mobile IDs seen over time at a mosque in Dearborn, Michigan. Each red dot represents one mobile device.</p></div>
<p>In an interview, Atlas said a private investigator they hired was offered a free trial of Babel Street, which the investigator was able to use to determine the home address and daily movements of mobile devices belonging to multiple New Jersey police officers whose families have already faced significant harassment and death threats.</p>
<p>Atlas said the investigator encountered Babel Street while testing hundreds of data broker tools and services to see if personal information on its users was being sold. They soon discovered Babel Street also bundles people-search services with its platform, to make it easier for customers to zero in on a specific device.</p>
<p>The investigator contacted Babel Street about possibly buying home addresses in certain areas of New Jersey. After listening to a sales pitch for Babel Street and expressing interest, the investigator was told Babel Street only offers their service to the government or to “contractors of the government.”</p>
<p>“The investigator (truthfully) mentioned that he was contemplating some government contract work in the future and was told by the Babel Street salesperson that ‘that’s good enough’ and that ‘they don’t actually check,’” Atlas shared in an email with reporters.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was one of five media outlets invited to review screen recordings that Atlas made while its investigator used a two-week trial version of Babel Street’s LocateX service. References and links to reporting by other publications, including <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-u-s-government-bought-tool-that-can-track-phones-at-abortion-clinics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>404 Media</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/security/2024-10-23/ty-article-magazine/.premium/00000192-b90c-dc97-a593-f96f50800000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Haaretz</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.notus.org/technology/cell-phone-tracking-law-enforcement-abortion-clinic" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>NOTUS</strong></a>, and <strong>The New York Times</strong>, will appear throughout this story.</p>
<p>Collectively, these stories expose how the broad availability of mobile advertising data has created a market in which virtually anyone can build a sophisticated spying apparatus capable of tracking the daily movements of hundreds of millions of people globally.</p>
<p>The findings outlined in Atlas&#8217;s lawsuit against Babel Street also illustrate how mobile location data is set to massively complicate several hot-button issues, from the tracking of suspected illegal immigrants or women seeking abortions, to harassing public servants who are already in the crosshairs over baseless conspiracy theories and increasingly hostile political rhetoric against government employees.</p>
<h2>WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE</h2>
<p>Atlas says the Babel Street trial period allowed its investigator to find information about visitors to high-risk targets such as mosques, synagogues, courtrooms and abortion clinics. In one video, an Atlas investigator showed how they isolated mobile devices seen in a New Jersey courtroom parking lot that was reserved for jurors, and then tracked one likely juror’s phone to their home address over several days.</p>
<p>While the Atlas investigator had access to its trial account at Babel Street, they were able to successfully track devices belonging to several plaintiffs named or referenced in the lawsuit. They did so by drawing a digital polygon around the home address or workplace of each person in Babel Street’s platform, which focused exclusively on the devices that passed through those addresses each day.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69273" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69273" height="648" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69273">Each red dot in this Babel Street map represents a unique mobile device that has been seen since April 2022 at a Jewish synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif. Image: Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</p></div>
<p>One unique feature of Babel Street is the ability to toggle a “night” mode, which makes it relatively easy to determine within a few meters where a target typically lays their head each night (because their phone is usually not far away).</p>
<p>Atlas plaintiffs <strong>Scott</strong> and <strong>Justyna Maloney</strong> are both veteran officers with the Rahway, NJ police department who live together with their two young children. In April 2023, Scott and Justyna became the target of intense harassment and death threats after Officer Justyna responded to a routine call about a man filming people outside of the Motor Vehicle Commission in Rahway.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEZWtC9bdI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">man filming</a> the Motor Vehicle Commission that day is a social media personality who often solicits police contact and then records himself arguing about constitutional rights with the responding officers.</p>
<p>Officer Justyna’s interaction with the man was entirely peaceful, and the episode appeared to end without incident. But after a selectively edited video of that encounter went viral, their home address and unpublished phone numbers were posted online. When their tormentors figured out that Scott was also a cop (a sergeant), the couple began receiving dozens of threatening text messages, including specific death threats.</p>
<p>According to the Atlas lawsuit, one of the messages to Mr. Maloney demanded money, and warned that his family would &#8220;pay in blood&#8221; if he didn’t comply. Sgt. Maloney said he then received a video in which a masked individual pointed a rifle at the camera and told him that his family was &#8220;going to get [their] heads cut off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maloney said a few weeks later, one of their neighbors saw two suspicious individuals in ski masks parked one block away from the home and alerted police. Atlas’s complaint says video surveillance from neighboring homes shows the masked individuals circling the Maloney’s home. The responding officers arrested two men, who were armed, for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69289" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69289" height="437" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69289">According to Google Maps, Babel Street shares a corporate address with Google and the consumer credit reporting bureau TransUnion.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said their investigator was not able to conclusively find Scott Maloney’s iPhone in the Babel Street platform, but they did find Justyna’s. Babel Street had nearly 100,000 hits for her phone over several months, allowing Atlas to piece together an intimate picture of Justyna’s daily movements and meetings with others.<span id="more-69216"></span></p>
<p>An Atlas investigator visited the Maloneys and inspected Justyna’s iPhone, and determined the only app that used her device’s location data was from the department store <strong>Macy’s</strong>.</p>
<p>In a written response to questions, Macy&#8217;s said its app includes an opt-in feature for geo-location, &#8220;which allows customers to receive an enhanced shopping experience based on their location.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not store any customer location information,&#8221; Macy&#8217;s wrote. &#8220;We share geo-location data with a <a href="https://www.macys.com/ads.txt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limited number of partners</a> who help us deliver this enhanced app experience. Furthermore, we have no connection with Babel Street&#8221; [link added for context].</p>
<p>Justyna’s experience highlights a stark reality about the broad availability of mobile location data: Even if the person you’re looking for isn’t directly identifiable in platforms like Babel Street, it is likely that at least some of that person’s family members are. In other words, it’s often trivial to infer the location of one device by successfully locating another.</p>
<p>The terms of service for Babel Street’s Locate X service state that the product &#8220;may not be used as the basis for any legal process in any country, including as the basis for a warrant, subpoena, or any other legal or administrative action.&#8221; But Scott Maloney said he’s convinced by their experience that not even law enforcement agencies should have access to this capability without a warrant.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a law enforcement officer, in order for me to track someone I need a judge to sign a warrant &#8211; and that&#8217;s for a criminal investigation after we&#8217;ve developed probable cause,&#8221; Mr. Maloney said in an interview. &#8220;Data brokers tracking me and my family just to sell that information for profit, without our consent, and even after we&#8217;ve explicitly asked them not to is deeply disturbing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Maloney’s law enforcement colleagues in other states may see things differently. In August, <strong>The Texas Observer</strong> <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-dps-surveillance-tangle-cobwebs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that state police plan to spend more than $5 million on a contract for a controversial surveillance tool called <strong>Tangles</strong> from the tech firm PenLink. Tangles is an AI-based web platform that scrapes information from the open, deep and dark web, and it has a premier feature called <strong>WebLoc</strong> that can be used to geofence mobile devices.</p>
<p>The <strong>Associated Press</strong> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27ef" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported last month</a> that law enforcement agencies from suburban Southern California to rural North Carolina have been using an obscure cell phone tracking tool called <strong>Fog Reveal</strong> — at times without warrants — that gives them the ability to follow people’s movements going back many months.</p>
<p>It remains unclear precisely how Babel Street is obtaining the abundance of mobile location data made available to users of its platform. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>But according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2020-HQFO-01656.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a document</a> (PDF) obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Science and Technology directorate, Babel Street re-hosts data from the commercial phone tracking firm <strong>Venntel</strong>.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Substack newsletter <strong>All-Source Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_29FTC124C0060_2900_-NONE-_-NONE-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unearthed documents</a> indicating that the <strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</strong> has opened an inquiry into Venntel and its parent company Gravy Analytics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Venntel has also been a data partner of the police surveillance contractor Fog Data Science, whose product has been described as ‘mass surveillance on a budget,'&#8221; All-Source&#8217;s <strong>Jack Poulson</strong> <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/ftc-opened-investigation-into-commercial" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;Venntel was also reported to have been a primary data source of the controversial ‘Locate X’ phone tracking product of the American data fusion company Babel Street.&#8221;</p>
<h2>MAID IN HELL</h2>
<p>The Mobile Advertising ID or MAID — the unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each mobile device — was originally envisioned as a way to distinguish individual mobile customers without relying on personally identifiable information such as phone numbers or email addresses.</p>
<p>However, there is now <a href="https://datarade.ai/data-categories/device-graph-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a robust industry</a> of marketing and advertising companies that specialize in assembling enormous lists of MAIDs that are &#8220;enriched&#8221; with historical and personal information about the individual behind each MAID.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69270" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69270" height="411" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69270">One of many vendors that &#8220;enrich&#8221; MAID data with other identifying information, including name, address, email address and phone number.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said its investigator wanted to know whether they could find enriched MAID records on their New Jersey law enforcement customers, and soon found plenty of ad data brokers willing to sell it.</p>
<p>Some vendors offered only a handful of data fields, such as first and last name, MAID and email address. Other brokers sold far more detailed histories along with their MAID, including each subject’s social media profiles, precise GPS coordinates, and even likely consumer category.</p>
<p>How are advertisers and data brokers gaining access to so much information? Some sources of MAID data can be apps on your phone such as <strong>AccuWeather</strong>, <strong>GasBuddy</strong>, <strong>Grindr</strong>, and <strong>MyFitnessPal</strong> that collect your MAID and location and sell that to brokers.</p>
<p>A user&#8217;s MAID profile and location data also is commonly shared as a consequence of simply using a smartphone to visit a web page that features ads. In the few milliseconds before those ads load, the website will send a &#8220;<strong>bid request</strong>&#8221; to various ad exchanges, where advertisers can bid on the chance to place their ad in front of users who match the consumer profiles they’re seeking. A great deal of data can be included in a bid request, including the user&#8217;s precise location (the current open standard for bid requests is detailed <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>The trouble is that virtually anyone can access the &#8220;bidstream&#8221; data flowing through these so-called &#8220;<strong>realtime bidding</strong>&#8221; networks, because the information is simultaneously broadcast in the clear to hundreds of entities around the world.</p>
<p>The result is that there are a number of marketing companies that now enrich and broker access to this mobile location information. Earlier this year, the German news outlet <strong>netzpolitik.org</strong> purchased a bidstream data set containing more than 3.6 billion data points, and shared the information with the German daily <strong>BR24</strong>. They concluded that the data they obtained (through a free trial, no less) made it possible to establish movement profiles — some of them quite precise — of <a href="https://interaktiv.br.de/ausspioniert-mit-standortdaten/en/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">several million people across Germany</a>.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69268" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69268" height="492" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/br24-netzpolitik.png" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69268">A screenshot from the BR24/Netzpolitik story about their ability to track millions of Germans, including many employees of the German Federal Police and Interior Ministry.</p></div>
<p><strong>Politico</strong> recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/23/tk-alfred-top-00180521" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered</a> startling <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941708" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research</a> from universities in New Hampshire, Kentucky and St. Louis that showed how the mobile advertising data they acquired allowed them to link visits from investigators with the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) to insiders selling stock before the investigations became public knowledge.</p>
<p>The researchers in that study said they didn&#8217;t attempt to use the same methods to track regulators from other agencies, but that virtually anyone could do it.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Sherman</strong>, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law&#8217;s Center for Privacy and Technology, called the research a &#8220;shocking demonstration of what happens when companies can freely harvest Americans’ geolocation data and sell it for their chosen price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Politicians should understand how they, their staff, and public servants are threatened by the sale of personal data—and constituent groups should realize that talk of data broker &#8216;controls&#8217; or &#8216;best practices&#8221; is designed by companies to distract from the underlying problems and the comprehensive privacy and security solutions, Sherman <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/data-brokers-and-threats-to-government-employees" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote for Lawfare this week</a>.</p>
<h2>A BIDSTREAM DRAGNET?</h2>
<p>The Orwellian nature of modern mobile advertising networks may soon have far-reaching implications for women’s reproductive rights, as more states move to outlaw abortion within their borders. The 2022 Dobbs decision by the U.S. Supreme Court discarded the federal right to abortion, and 14 states have since enacted strict abortion bans.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups are already using mobile advertising data to advance their cause. In May 2023, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/IZenH" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that an anti-abortion group in Wisconsin used precise geolocation data to direct ads to women it suspected of seeking abortions.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is little to stop antiabortion groups from purchasing bidstream data (or renting access to a platform like Babel Street) and using it to geofence abortion clinics, potentially revealing all mobile devices transiting through these locations.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator geofenced an abortion clinic and was able to identify a likely employee at that clinic, following their daily route to and from that individual&#8217;s home address.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69272" style="width: 1610px;"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-69272 size-full" height="1195" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" width="1600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69272">A still shot from a video Atlas shared of its use of Babel Street to identify and track an employee traveling each day between their home and the clinic.</p></div>
<p>Last year, Idaho became the first state to outlaw &#8220;abortion trafficking,&#8221; which the <strong>Idaho Capital Sun</strong> <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/26/helping-a-minor-travel-for-an-abortion-some-states-have-made-it-a-crime/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> is defined as &#8220;recruiting, harboring or transporting a pregnant minor to get an abortion or abortion medication without parental permission.&#8221; Tennessee now has a similar law, and GOP lawmakers in five other states introduced abortion trafficking bills that failed to advance this year, the Sun reports.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator used Babel Street to identify and track a person traveling from their home in Alabama &#8212; where abortion is now illegal &#8212; to an abortion clinic just over the border in Tallahassee, Fla. &#8212; and back home again within a few hours. Abortion rights advocates and providers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/nx-s1-5082217/can-alabama-prosecute-someone-for-helping-people-travel-out-of-state-for-an-abortion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are currently suing Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall</a>, seeking to block him from prosecuting people who help patients travel out-of-state to end pregnancies.</p>
<p><strong>Eva Galperin</strong>, director of cybersecurity at the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation </strong>(EFF), a non-profit digital rights group, said she’s extremely concerned about dragnet surveillance of people crossing state lines in order to get abortions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Specifically, Republican officials from states that have outlawed abortion have made it clear that they are interested in targeting people who have gone to neighboring states in order to get abortions, and to make it more difficult for people who are seeking abortions to go to neighboring states,&#8221; Galperin said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a great leap to imagine that states will do this.&#8221;</p>
<h2>APPLES AND GOOGLES</h2>
<p>Atlas found that for the right price (typically $10-50k a year), brokers can provide access to tens of billions of data points covering large swaths of the US population and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Based on the data sets Atlas acquired — many of which included older MAID records — they estimate they could locate roughly 80 percent of Android-based devices, and about 25 percent of Apple phones. Google refers to its MAID as the &#8220;<strong>Android Advertising ID</strong>,&#8221; (AAID) while Apple calls it the &#8220;<strong>Identifier for Advertisers</strong>&#8221; (IDFA).</p>
<p>What accounts for the disparity between the number of Android and Apple devices that can be found in mobile advertising data? In April 2021, Apple shipped version 14.5 of its iOS operating system, which introduced a technology called <strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong> (ATT) that requires apps to get affirmative consent before they can track users by their IDFA or any other identifier.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s introduction of ATT had a swift and profound impact on the advertising market: Less than a year later Facebook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that the iPhone privacy feature would decrease the company’s 2022 revenues by about $10 billion.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69274" style="width: 890px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69274" height="324" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png" width="880" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69274">Source: cnbc.com.</p></div>
<p>Google runs by far the world&#8217;s largest ad exchange, known as <strong>AdX</strong>. The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/technology/google-ad-antitrust-trial-arguments.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accused Google of building a monopoly</a> over the technology that places ads on websites, estimates that Google&#8217;s ad exchange controls 47 percent of the U.S. market and 56 percent globally.</p>
<p>According to recent figures, Google&#8217;s <strong>Android</strong> is also the dominant mobile operating system worldwide, with more than 72 percent of the market. In the U.S., however, iPhone users claim approximately 55 percent of the market, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ios-vs-android-market-share/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TechRepublic</a>.</p>
<p>In response to requests for comment, Google said it does not send real time bidding requests to Babel Street, nor does it share precise location data in bid requests. The company added that its policies explicitly prohibit the sale of data from real-time bidding, or its use for any purpose other than advertising.</p>
<p>Google said its MAIDs are randomly generated and do not contain IP addresses, GPS coordinates, or any other location data, and that its ad systems do not share anyone’s precise location data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Android has clear controls for users to manage app access to device location, and reset or delete their advertising ID,&#8221; Google’s written statement reads. &#8220;If we learn that someone, whether an app developer, ad tech company or anyone else, is violating our policies, we take appropriate action. Beyond that, we support legislation and industry collaboration to address these types of data practices that negatively affect the entire mobile ecosystem, including all operating systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a written statement shared with reporters, Apple said Location Services is not on by default in its devices. Rather, users must enable Location Services and must give permission to each app or website to use location data. Users can turn Location Services off at any time, and can change whether apps have access to location at any time. The user&#8217;s choices include precise vs. approximate location, as well as a one-time grant of location access by the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and build privacy protections into each of our products and services to put the user in control of their data,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said. &#8220;We minimize personal data collection, and where possible, process data only on users’ devices.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Zach Edwards</strong> is a senior threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm <strong>SilentPush</strong> who has studied the location data industry closely. Edwards said Google and Apple can&#8217;t keep pretending like the MAIDs being broadcast into the bidstream from hundreds of millions of American devices aren’t making most people trivially trackable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The privacy risks here will remain until Apple and Google permanently turn off their mobile advertising ID schemes and admit to the American public that this is the technology that has been supporting the global data broker ecosystem,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>STATES ACT, WHILE CONGRESS DITHERS</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Bloomberg Law</strong>, between 2019 and 2023, threats against federal judges have more than doubled. Amid increasingly hostile political rhetoric and conspiracy theories against government officials, a growing number of states are <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/cops-battle-data-brokers-for-privacy-in-constitutional-clash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seeking to pass their own versions of Daniel’s Law</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, a retired <strong>West Virginia</strong> police officer <a href="https://therecord.media/west-virginia-law-enforcement-sues-broker" rel="noopener" target="_blank">filed a class action lawsuit</a> against the people-search service Whitepages for listing their personal information in violation of a statute the state passed in 2021 that largely mirrors Daniel’s Law.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Maryland passed the <strong>Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act</strong> — named after a county circuit court judge who was murdered by an individual involved in a divorce proceeding over which he was presiding. The law allows current and former members of the Maryland judiciary to request their personal information not be made available to the public.</p>
<p>Under the Maryland law, personal information can include a home address; telephone number, email address; Social Security number or federal tax ID number; bank account or payment card number; a license plate or other unique vehicle identifier; a birth or marital record; a child’s name, school, or daycare; place of worship; place of employment for a spouse, child, or dependent.</p>
<p>The law firm <strong>Troutman Pepper</strong> <a href="https://www.troutman.com/insights/maryland-enacts-the-judge-andrew-f-wilkinson-judicial-security-act-are-more-daniels-laws-on-the-horizon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">writes</a> that &#8220;so far in 2024, 37 states have begun considering or have adopted similar privacy-based legislation designed to protect members of the judiciary and, in some states, other government officials involved in law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Atlas alleges that in response to requests to have data on its New Jersey law enforcement clients scrubbed from consumer records sold by <strong>LexisNexis</strong>, the data broker retaliated by freezing the credit of approximately 18,500 people, and falsely reporting them as identity theft victims.</p>
<p>In addition, Atlas said LexisNexis started returning failure codes indicating they had no record of these individuals, resulting in denials when officers attempted to refinance loans or open new bank accounts.</p>
<p>The data broker industry has responded by having at least 70 of the Atlas lawsuits moved to federal court, and challenging the constitutionality of the New Jersey statute as overly broad and a violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the data broker industry argued in their motion to dismiss that there is “no First Amendment doctrine that exempts a content-based restriction from strict scrutiny just because it has some nexus with a privacy interest.”</p>
<p>Atlas&#8217;s lawyers responded that data covered under Daniel&#8217;s Law &#8212; personal information of New Jersey law enforcement officers &#8212; is not free speech. Atlas notes that while defending against comparable lawsuits, the data broker industry has argued that home address and phone number data are not &#8220;communications.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Data brokers should not be allowed to argue that information like addresses are not &#8216;communications&#8217; in one context, only to turn around and claim that addresses are protectable communications,&#8221; Atlas <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/5.-PLAINTIFFS-MEMORANDUM-OF-LAW-IN-OPPOSITION-TO-DEFENDANTS-CONSOLIDATED-MOTION-TO-DISMISS-PLAINTIFFS-COMPLAINT.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">argued</a> (PDF). &#8220;Nor can their change of course alter the reality that the data at issue is not speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge overseeing the challenge is expected to rule on the motion to dismiss within the next few weeks. Regardless of the outcome, the decision is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, media law experts say they’re concerned that enacting Daniel’s Law in other states could limit the ability of journalists to hold public officials accountable, and allow authorities <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/09/21/judge-declines-to-limit-daniels-law-for-reporters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to pursue criminal charges against media outlets</a> that publish the same type of public and government records that fuel the people-search industry.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.) said Congress&#8217; failure to regulate data brokers, and the administration&#8217;s continued opposition to bipartisan legislation that would limit data sales to law enforcement, have created this current privacy crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether location data is being used to identify and expose closeted gay Americans, or to track people as they cross state lines to seek reproductive health care, data brokers are selling Americans&#8217; deepest secrets and exposing them to serious harm, all for a few bucks,” Wyden said in a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, 404 Media, Haaretz, NOTUS, and The New York Times.</p>
<p>Sen. Wyden said Google also deserves blame for refusing to follow Apple&#8217;s lead by removing companies&#8217; ability to track phones.</p>
<p>“Google&#8217;s insistence on uniquely tracking Android users &#8211; and allowing ad companies to do so as well &#8211; has created the technical foundations for the surveillance economy and the abuses stemming from it,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>Georgetown Law&#8217;s Justin Sherman said the data broker and mobile ad industries claim there are protections in place to anonymize mobile location data and restrict access to it, and that there are limits to the kinds of invasive inferences one can make from location data. The data broker industry also likes to tout the usefulness of mobile location data in fighting retail fraud, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All kinds of things can be inferred from this data, including people being targeted by abusers, or people with a particular health condition or religious belief,&#8221; Sherman said. &#8220;You can track jurors, law enforcement officers visiting the homes of suspects, or military intelligence people meeting with their contacts. The notion that the sale of all this data is preventing harm and fraud is hilarious in light of all the harm it causes enabling people to better target their cyber operations, or learning about people&#8217;s extramarital affairs and extorting public officials.&#8221;</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>Privacy experts say disabling or deleting your device&#8217;s MAID will have no effect on how your phone operates, except that you may begin to see far less targeted ads on that device.</p>
<p>Any Android apps with permission to use your location should appear when you navigate to the Settings app, Location, and then App Permissions. &#8220;Allowed all the time&#8221; is the most permissive setting, followed by &#8220;Allowed only while in use,&#8221; &#8220;Ask every time,&#8221; and &#8220;Not allowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Android users can delete their ad ID permanently, by opening the Settings app and navigating to Privacy &gt; Ads. Tap &#8220;Delete advertising ID,&#8221; then tap it again on the next page to confirm. According to the EFF, this will prevent any app on your phone from accessing the ad ID in the future.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69276" style="width: 660px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69276" height="589" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/android-ads-optout.png" width="650" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69276">Image: eff.org</p></div>
<p>By default, Apple&#8217;s iOS requires apps to ask permission before they can access your device&#8217;s IDFA. When you install a new app, it may ask for permission to track you. When prompted to do so by an app, select the &#8220;Ask App Not to Track&#8221; option. Apple users also can set the &#8220;Allow apps to request to track&#8221; switch to the &#8220;off&#8221; position, which will block apps from asking to track you.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69278" style="width: 585px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69278" height="390" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/applerequesttotrack.png" width="575" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69278">Apple&#8217;s Privacy and Ad Tracking Settings.</p></div>
<p>Apple also has its own targeted advertising system which is separate from third-party tracking enabled by the IDFA. To disable it, go to Settings, Privacy, and Apple Advertising, and ensure that the &#8220;Personalized Ads&#8221; setting is set to &#8220;off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re the type of reader who&#8217;s the default IT support person for a small group of family or friends (bless your heart), it would be a good idea to set their devices not to track them, and to disable any apps that may have location data sharing turned on 24/7.</p>
<p>There is a dual benefit to this altruism, which is clearly in the device owner&#8217;s best interests. Because while <em>your</em> device may not be directly trackable via advertising data, making sure they&#8217;re opted out of said tracking also can reduce the likelihood that you are trackable simply by being physically close to those who <em>are</em>.</p>

Then, over the weekend, information about the theft of data from Providence Public School District (PPSD) was shown on a regular website with a video preview.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A cybercriminal group called Medusa appears to have taken control of the dark web ransom page where the 201 gigabytes of data from the CIA were allegedly leaked by cybercriminals in September, simply because they can access it through any internet browser.

The district hired an undisclosed "vendor with expertise in cyber-security" to conduct an ongoing analysis of the network and audit it on behalf of a third-party IT agency.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This cyberattack was reported to the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Rhode Island State Police.

It took the district until now to disclose the nature of the security breach, as there has been a tight-lipped stance on the matter. On Sept. 11, IT staff was instructed to shut down the entire network as a result of abnormal activity that was detected, and they wouldn't be able to provide any further details. More than a week has passed since teachers and students were unable to access online curriculum, email, or use computers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As the district works on forensics to determine what caused the breach, a credit monitoring agreement has been finalized with a vendor not yet identified and a letter containing information about how staff can access these services is being written for distribution to employees “very soon,” district spokesperson Jay G. Wégimont said in a letter to staff.

According to BCC spokesperson Brian Hodge, the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office still has not been officially notified of the data breach and is awaiting formal notification from the company.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon confirmation of a breach of personal information, any municipal or government agency must notify the Attorney General's office, credit reporting agencies, and individuals affected by the breach within 30 days of the incident.

In a letter from Superintendent Javier Montaez to the Providence School Board on Sept. 25, the PPSD first used the term "unauthorized access" to refer to the breach, though the term "breach" was also used in the public statement that the Providence School Board issued on September 18.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is "encouraging" that the Providence school district is informing potentially affected employees and finalizing the credit monitoring contract as soon as possible, spokeswoman Anthony Vega said in an email sent to Rhode Island Current on Tuesday, that he received from the mayor.

It was reported in an e-mail sent by a spokesperson for the Providence City Council that the council would not be able to comment. Despite requests for comment, the governor's office did not get back to the Guardian with a response.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Despite repeated requests for comment from Rhode Island Current, Rogel has not responded to any of those requests.

There seemed to be a discrepancy between the school board president's use of the term "breach" and that of the district's official language which avoided stating the exact nature of the problem. The PPSD community was informed on Sept. 12 that the district's network had experienced "irregular activity," which ultimately led computer staff to cut off internet access to the district's offices and schools across the district.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is still a large lack of broadband availability in Providence schools, aside from a fleet of WiFi hotspots that are being deployed to provide connectivity in the absence of a main network.

There was a letter from PPSD to residents sent on Sept. 16 informing them that a forensic analysis was still being conducted and that no evidence had been found that PPSD data had been compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, Medusa appeared to claim credit for the "irregular activity" on Monday by posting a message to their publicly accessible ransom blog claiming 41 watermarked, sometimes partially obscured screenshots that preview the contents of the 201 gigabytes of data that the hackers claim to have stolen. The hackers also included identifying information — including serial numbers of employee cell phones and parent contact information — that helped identify the content of the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Medusa ransomware is an extremely dangerous malware that works quietly in the background after it has penetrated a system and accumulated exploitable data. Once the bounty has reached a sufficient amount, the database will encrypt the files to prevent users from accessing them. Ransom notes are then sent to victims demanding that they pay a ransom in exchange for the release of their files. There has also been a growing trend of "double extortion", where the hackers are not only stealing files but are also selling or releasing the data to the public if they do not receive payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A ransom page indicates that, in exchange for a payment of $1 million, PPSD can retrieve or delete its data. An additional day would be added to the timer if $100,000 was paid. Based on the hackers' countdown timer, the deadline for submitting the hack will be Sept. 25 in the morning.&nbsp;


Deloitte, however, released a report on Monday showing that state-level IT officials and security officers are unsure about the budgets that will be allocated to their state's telecommunications network infrastructure due to the uncertainty around it.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"The attack surface is increasing as state leaders become more reliant on information when it comes to operating government itself as the use of information is becoming more central," Srini Subramanian, a principal at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, told States Newsroom in an interview. Chief information security officers (CISOs) face an increasing number of challenges, and they have to make sure that the IT infrastructure survives ever-increasing cyber threats posed by hackers.

This difficulty was reflected in the survey results, which revealed that almost half of all respondents did not know their state's cybersecurity budget, which resulted from these challenges. Around 40% of state IT officers reported that they needed more money to comply with regulations or meet other legal requirements to comply with government regulations.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Those findings were confirmed this year by a report published by Moody's Ratings in 2023, which scores and analyzes municipal bonds. Robust cybersecurity practices can reduce exposure to threats to the enterprise, but initiatives that are difficult to implement and take resources away from core business functions may pose a credit challenge, according to Gregory Sobel, a Moody analyst and assistant vice president.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One study by Moody's also revealed that 92% of local governments have cyber insurance, an unprecedented two-fold increase over the last five years, according to Moody's. It is important to note that the popularity of this system did come with higher rates: a county in South Carolina went from paying a $70,000 premium in 2021 to a $210,000 premium in 2022 for this system. Aside from the higher costs, there are also stricter stipulations on risk management practices that need to be followed before a policy can be paid, such as better firewalls, consistent data backups, and multi-factor authentication, all of which make it difficult to get it to pay out.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During an email exchange with Rhode Island Current, Douglas W. Hubbard, CEO of Hubbard Decision Research, a consulting firm, and the author of “How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk,” informed the paper that schools should make use of the low-cost, free, or shared resources available to them to manage cyber risk more effectively.</div>

The company revealed the incident to the public on Monday, stating that the breach occurred between August 3 and August 6. Avis, which is part of the Avis Budget Group, sent notifications to affected customers last week, advising them on how to protect themselves from potential identity theft or fraud.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Avis Budget Group, which owns both Avis and Budget, operates over 10,000 rental locations across 180 countries, generating $12 billion in revenue in 2023, according to its most recent financial report. However, the recent data breach has cast a shadow over its operations, highlighting vulnerabilities in its data security measures. In a data breach notice filed with the Iowa Attorney General’s office, Avis disclosed that the compromised information includes customer names, dates of birth, mailing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, credit card details, and driver’s license numbers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A separate filing with the Maine Attorney General revealed that the data breach has impacted a total of 299,006 individuals so far. Texas has the highest number of affected residents, with 34,592 impacted, according to a report filed with the Texas Attorney General. The fact that sensitive personal information was stored in a manner that allowed it to be accessed by cybercriminals has raised serious questions about the company’s data protection practices.

Avis first became aware of the data breach on August 5 and took immediate steps to stop the unauthorized access to its systems.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The company stated that it had launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident and enlisted third-party security consultants to help identify the breach’s origins and scope. Avis has not yet disclosed specific details about the nature of the attack, the vulnerabilities exploited, or the identity of the perpetrators, leaving many questions unanswered.

This breach underscores the growing challenges faced by companies in protecting customer data in an increasingly digital world. While Avis acted quickly to contain the breach, the company’s reputation could suffer due to the extent of the data compromised and the sensitive nature of the information accessed.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The breach also serves as a reminder of the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, especially for businesses that handle large volumes of personal and financial data.

The incident has also prompted scrutiny from regulators and data privacy advocates. Many are questioning how sensitive customer information was stored and protected and why it was vulnerable to such an attack. Companies like Avis must ensure they are equipped with advanced security systems, encryption protocols, and regular audits to prevent such breaches from occurring in the future.

As the investigation continues, Avis customers are advised to monitor their financial accounts closely, watch for signs of identity theft, and take appropriate measures.</div>

This action occurred on the same day the platform released its recapture plan.

It was discovered that the perpetrator on Monday moved 2,500 Ether tokens worth about $6.3 million to Tornado Cash - a service that even blurs the origin of crypto assets - after attending the briefing session led by WazirX cofounder Nischal Shetty, who is based in Dubai.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In August, WazirX was hacked by an unknown group of hackers, who have remained unidentified since the heist took place in July and are reportedly moving the funds that have been stolen around. A recent piece of data collected by Arkham Research suggests that the hacker is using a controversial platform called Tornado Cash to commit his crimes.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A hacker who stole more than $230 million (roughly Rs. 1,900 crore) appears to have moved some $54.5 crore of Ether tokens worth of the stolen cryptocurrency $230 million into Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency platform that is now sanctioned by the United States government.

Using Tornado Cash, users can deposit their crypto tokens into a pool that contains various crypto tokens and then have their funds transferred to the destination wallet in the form of other cryptocurrencies after depositing their funds.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Over the past few years, Tornado Cash has become one of the most popular tools used by cybercriminals who want to let no evidence of their illicit activities trail them when transferring funds they have gained through illicit means.

As the data by Arkham shows, the hacker was able to facilitate 26 transactions through the use of his credentials to transfer the aforementioned amount to a Tornado Cash address.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, Etherscan data showed that the hacker moved the funds through various Bitcoin transactions, each carried out with 100 Ethereum units. 

It has been reported that social media users have been able to capture pictures of these details.

Data tracked by Arkham shows that the attacker moved nearly $4 million worth of ether [ETH] in 16 transactions through a Tornado Cash router, some of which were obtained through the Ethereum network.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This address is currently holding over $155 million worth of various tokens, with a majority of the funds being ether, which at $150 million has accumulated over the past few months.


On the other hand, WazirX recently revealed that, almost one week before the withdrawal window was supposed to open, users had begun to be able to withdraw up to 66% of their Indian rupee token balances from the exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the theft of funds, over 45% of the total reserves cited by the exchange in a June 2024 report have gone missing - and the exchange has since filed for a restructuring process to move forward on clearing its liabilities to recover the money.

In a statement on Monday, WazirX's legal advisers stated that it is unlikely that the company will be able to make good on its obligations in crypto terms going forward, with the best-case scenario being a refund of anywhere between 55% and 57%.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This attack is believed to have been conducted by Lazarus, a North Korean hacking unit, as previously reported by Reuters. It has been estimated that the group laundered over $1 billion in stolen funds through this service before OFAC sanctions were imposed in 2022, according to estimates put forward by the group.

Nischal Shetty, father of WazirX and co-founder of the company, confirmed that the hacker hasn't been identified yet.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking group that has been associated with North Korea for quite a while, has previously been alleged to have been involved in this hack.

Last week, WazirX initiated its first steps toward financial restructuring in the aftermath of the recent hacking incident. As part of this effort, the cryptocurrency exchange has filed for a moratorium in a Singapore court.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This legal action grants WazirX a reprieve, allowing it additional time to thoroughly assess its financial liabilities and reorganize its capital structure. The entire restructuring process is expected to take up to six months before it is fully completed.

In the interim, WazirX has reopened withdrawals for Indian Rupees (INR) on its platform.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The exchange is actively encouraging its users to withdraw 66 percent of their unfrozen INR balances, which have been made available for withdrawal at this stage. This measure is aimed at ensuring greater user security and providing liquidity during the ongoing restructuring phase.</div>

This might be the case because a lot of individuals found out about the news only after reading the stories they had missed over the weekend, or because third-party sources of app store intelligence take a little longer to report changes in rankings.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to Appfigures, an app intelligence company, Telegram didn't rise to the No. 2 spot on the Social Networking charts on the U.S. App Store until 3 a.m. EST on Monday, suggesting that the app is just now starting to gain traction. The app had already fallen to No. 3 in Social in the U.S. as of the time of publication, so it might only be a temporary boost.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, the app shot to the top of the App Store's Social Networking category and rose to become the third most popular app overall in France, the country where Durov was arrested. After climbing ten spots since Friday, Telegram now stands at No. 8 in the top apps chart (which does not include games). Appfigures stated that this is the highest position it has held here since at least January 1, 2023. Apple often uses a combination of measures, including download velocity and app install count, to determine app store rankings.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Nevertheless, the cliché "any press is good press" appears to hold true, at least in terms of Telegram's exposure on the App Store. As consumers downloaded the app out of curiosity — or possibly to support the founder's views about "free speech" — it began to rise in the rankings.</span></div></span>

A hacktivist group known as Head Mare has been linked to cyber attacks that exclusively target organizations located in Russia and Belarus.
"Head Mare uses more up-to-date methods for obtaining initial access," Kaspersky said in a Monday analysis of the group's tactics and tools.

Numerous attacks disrupt court operations and have broader implications, as they hurt employers who use public records to check their criminal records. Gaining a deeper understanding of the nature and impact of these cyberattacks reveals an urgent need to strengthen cybersecurity measures within the courts to safeguard sensitive information and maintain the public's trust in the system.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta, has also suffered a significant ransomware attack in late January and was similar in scope and impact to the one in California. It is claimed that the attack, which is attributed to the ransomware group LockBit, has caused a suspension of most government services, including the issuance of vehicle registrations, and marriage licenses, as well as the ability of the courts to process legal documents online.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a consequence, if the hacker's demands were not met by the government, they threatened to release sensitive data, including potentially high-profile information related to ongoing criminal investigations. Although Fulton County officials were threatened with such threats, they refused to pay the ransom and have been constantly working to restore services and systems across the county. As of more than a month after the hacking attack, some services have not been restored, showing the long-term impact of attacks like these on the operations of local governments and courts for years to come.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Georgia's largest county, hackers shut down office phone lines, left clerks unable to issue motor vehicle registrations or marriage licenses, and threatened to publically release sensitive data they claimed to have stolen if officials did not pay ransom. The county is currently in the process of repairing the damage that was inflicted on it a month ago by hackers.

This post is part of a series on the Ransomware syndicate LockBit, which took credit for a cyberattack that crippled the government services in Fulton County, which is the largest county in Atlanta and includes much of the city.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They started demanding payment from the residents, threatening to dump personal information as part of the data dump online if payment was not made. There is also a claim that the hackers were able to steal records relating to the criminal case against former President Donald Trump, which is pending at the moment.

Ransomware groups routinely steal data from victims before activating malware that encrypts networks before they activate it to maximize their chances of getting paid.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to some cybersecurity analysts, it doesn't appear that the Fulton County hackers had actual access to files related to Donald Trump.



Kansas Court System Breach

During October, the Kansas Office of Judicial Administration detected some unauthorized activity on its computers and networks, and immediately took action to protect its systems and data from any further harm. It was determined by the office and cybersecurity experts that some files were stolen after they were involved in the investigation of the incident.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the complexity of the data, it took until May to be able to determine the specific personal information that was affected or identified impacted individuals based on a manual review of the relevant data. Kansas courts began notifying victims in May, and the courts offered credit monitoring and identity recovery services to those who were affected.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Although reported breaches have generally been detected fairly quickly, it should be noted that recovery efforts have not yet been completed. It is with great regret to inform you that Kansas courts have enhanced their security measures in response to this incident to protect their networks and information systems even better.



After the Kansas judicial system was knocked offline for weeks in October by a cyberattack that involved the theft of personal information from about 150,000 people, the Kansas judicial system may have been breached and may have had their personal information stolen.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of an independent investigation conducted by a third party, the Office of Judicial Administration on Monday announced that it found evidence to support the cyberattack. Information that the office has accessed during this attack has been obtained through documents that have belonged to the office as a result of litigation appealed to the Kansas appellate court, applications made to the Kansas bar, and other documents.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is a possibility that information from any number of sources, such as social security numbers, driving licenses, government identification cards, credit card information, tax ID numbers, passport numbers, and information about health insurance policies, could have been accessed.

Cybersecurity threats posed by the federal government

In recent years, cyberattacks have become more common in the judicial system, and this is not a new issue. It was disclosed recently that two federal judges have issued warnings before a committee of the U.S.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The committee noted that the ageing database systems of the judiciary could be vulnerable to attacks, making a case for the need to upgrade them and increase funding for security measures. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy St. Eve, who chairs the Judicial Conference of the United States budget committee, has emphasized that the judiciary has suffered from a lack of investment for years, leaving it vulnerable as a result of continuing under-investment.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">U.S. District Judge Roslynn Mauskopf, serving as the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, has brought to attention a significant escalation in cyberattacks targeting the judiciary. Judge Mauskopf emphasized that these rising threats not only jeopardize the functioning of the justice system but also pose a broader danger to the integrity of democracy itself.

In response to this growing menace, the federal judiciary has sought $8.6 billion in discretionary funding for the fiscal year 2023, representing a 7.2% increase from the previous year.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This budget request includes a substantial allocation of $403 million specifically designated for IT security and modernization, as well as $786 million earmarked for court security. These figures underscore the heightened concerns regarding the safety of federal judges and courthouses. As cyber threats continue to advance in sophistication and frequency, it is anticipated that funding requests will persistently rise, particularly in critical areas such as IT security and court protection, to address ongoing challenges and support essential modernization initiatives.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While the federal judiciary can request significant funds to bolster its cybersecurity measures, state and local courts often operate under considerably tighter financial constraints. These courts, which are responsible for handling the majority of everyday legal proceedings, contain vast repositories of sensitive personal information. However, due to limited budgets, they may struggle to implement robust cybersecurity defences. This disparity highlights a critical issue: as cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, the need for cybersecurity investment is not confined to the federal level alone.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">State and local courts face substantial risks if they are unable to adequately protect their data, a vulnerability that could have far-reaching consequences for the justice system and undermine public trust.

The judiciary's role as custodian of some of the nation's most sensitive information makes cybersecurity an essential and urgent priority.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The testimonies of Judges St. Eve and Mauskopf underscore the critical need to modernize and safeguard vital judicial data. As cyberattacks continue to evolve, both federal and state judicial systems must prioritize cybersecurity measures to ensure the integrity of their operations and to maintain public confidence in the judicial process. Without adequate investment, particularly at the state and local levels, the judicial system may remain exposed to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, thereby endangering not only individual court cases but also the broader principles of justice and democracy.</div>

<title>#FreeDurov: Hacktivists Scramble on Telegram Supporting Pavel’s Release</title>

<p><img alt="Blog Telegram" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="600" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blog-Telegram.webp" tabindex="0" width="1200" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The arrest of Telegram's founder and CEO, Pavel Durov, on August 24, 2024, due to allegations that his messaging platform has been used for various illicit activities has sparked significant international attention and debate, particularly around issues of freedom of speech and the responsibilities of social media platforms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Conversely, the arrest has also incited the ire of several hacktivist groups in cyberspace because, for many in this community, Durov is more than just a tech entrepreneur; he is the mastermind behind two pivotal communication platforms in their lives: Vkontakte, Russia’s answer to Facebook, and the anonymous messaging app Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Vkontakte played a significant role in fostering communication and forming groups within hacktivist collectives. It was also a treasure trove of information for Russian hacktivists, thanks partly to its lax approach to copyright enforcement. Prior to Durov being forced to sell the platform, it was renowned for its virtually unmatched collection of illicit content.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Telegram later took on a similar role, providing a haven for pro-Russian hacktivists to organize, form communities, and sell services and software. With minimal moderation and Durov’s libertarian stance on privacy and free speech, hacktivist movements felt secure operating on Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Interestingly, Durov’s detention also sparked a rare moment of unity among unlikely allies: the Russian government, pro-Russian activists, and even members of the Russian opposition in exile. All three groups expressed skepticism toward the decision by French authorities, albeit in different ways.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While the Russian government and opposition followed the conventional route of issuing official statements, pro-Russian hacktivists quickly rallied to launch<a> #FreeDurov and #OpDurov </a>campaigns, signaling their support for Durov and Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FreeDurov and #OpDurov</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>News of Pavel Durov’s detention on Saturday evening, August 24, in France quickly spread like wildfire across Russian activists’ channels and chats on Telegram. Almost immediately, CRIL began monitoring the real-time reactions and activities of key Russian hacktivist groups and their allies:</p>

<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the first to react was the <strong>UserSec</strong> collective, which invited all other hacktivist groups to join the campaign against France. Several hacktivist alliances, such as the High Society and Holy League, shared these posts in their Telegram channels.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Two hours later, the group reported an attack on the Court of Cassation in France and the official website of the Administrative Court of Paris in conjunction with another infamous pro-Russian hacktivist group, the People's Cyber Army. People's Cyber Army administrators have been on the wanted list of criminals by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies since July 2024.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By Monday, August 26, several Russian and Pro-Russian hacktivist collectives, including Cyber Dragon, ReconSploit, Evilweb, Rootspolit, CGPlnet, and RipperSec, joined forces with UserSec and the People’s Cyber Army. Together, these groups launched coordinated <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/">cyber attacks</a> targeting various websites in France and organizations affiliated with the European Union.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The next day, August 27, 2024, UserSec continued its attacks on France, targeting the website of the French financial giant AXA Group.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":58251,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Additionally, hacktivist groups simultaneously attacked a wide range of targets, including airports in Bayonne and Marseille-Provence, ferry services in Corsica, the website of a French customs agency, the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF), and other entities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Despite widespread claims of a massive cyber assault planned for the day of the court hearing, CRIL recorded diminished activities, with People’s Cyber Army claiming to access Industrial Control Systems (ICS) components of a French dam on August 28. To support their claim, they released a video showing their intrusion and the modifications made to the system settings. An examination of the video reveals that the People’s Cyber Army gained access to one of the Power transmission control panels developed by French company ELEC-ENR of the <strong>Parc éolien de Tenbonrev</strong>, a wind farm located in the Brittany region of France.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pavel Durov’s Border Crossing Details Emerge in Leaked FSB Database</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As we analyze the events surrounding Pavel Durov’s detention in Paris, it’s impossible to overlook the timing of a significant data leak involving Russia’s FSB Border Service database in mid-August 2024.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>During this period, information surfaced on one of the Telegram-based database leak channels, revealing details of individuals who crossed Russia’s borders between 2014 and 2023. The database, named “Kordon 2023”, where “Kordon” means “border” in Russian slang, contains sensitive information such as each traveler’s full name, the date and location of the border crossing, the mode of transportation used, and the destination.</p>

<p>However, what stands out even more is that the leaked data contained records of Pavel Durov’s movements, a fact that directly contradicts his claims of having severed ties with Russia. The database revealed that Durov had traveled to Russia over 50 times since his immigration. Notably, he was in Russia on the very day that the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) announced their decision to list the ban from Telegram in Russia. Adding to the intrigue, the database mysteriously vanished shortly after its appearance, raising questions about who might have orchestrated this operation and for what purpose.</p>

<p>Several Russian investigative journalists have verified the authenticity and accuracy of this database.</p>

<p>The arrest of Pavel Durov and the subsequent legal measures imposed by the French court have sparked a significant surge in activity among both pro-Russian and other hacker groups. The #FreeDurov campaign has garnered support from not only pro-Palestinian factions but also various French teams and numerous other collectives. Telegram has become the primary platform for these groups to push their nefarious campaigns.</p>

<p>Also, these incidents highlight a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over the responsibilities of social media platforms in regulating content while upholding user privacy. The backlash from various factions underscores a collective apprehension about the implications of legal actions against tech leaders. As the situation develops, privacy advocates will be closely monitoring how these events may reshape the landscape of digital communication and the protections afforded to users in an increasingly regulated online environment. The outcome of Durov's case could set a precedent that either reinforces or undermines the principles of privacy and free speech that many Telegram users hold dear.</p>
