Then, over the weekend, information about the theft of data from Providence Public School District (PPSD) was shown on a regular website with a video preview.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A cybercriminal group called Medusa appears to have taken control of the dark web ransom page where the 201 gigabytes of data from the CIA were allegedly leaked by cybercriminals in September, simply because they can access it through any internet browser.

The district hired an undisclosed "vendor with expertise in cyber-security" to conduct an ongoing analysis of the network and audit it on behalf of a third-party IT agency.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This cyberattack was reported to the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Rhode Island State Police.

It took the district until now to disclose the nature of the security breach, as there has been a tight-lipped stance on the matter. On Sept. 11, IT staff was instructed to shut down the entire network as a result of abnormal activity that was detected, and they wouldn't be able to provide any further details. More than a week has passed since teachers and students were unable to access online curriculum, email, or use computers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As the district works on forensics to determine what caused the breach, a credit monitoring agreement has been finalized with a vendor not yet identified and a letter containing information about how staff can access these services is being written for distribution to employees “very soon,” district spokesperson Jay G. Wégimont said in a letter to staff.

According to BCC spokesperson Brian Hodge, the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office still has not been officially notified of the data breach and is awaiting formal notification from the company.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon confirmation of a breach of personal information, any municipal or government agency must notify the Attorney General's office, credit reporting agencies, and individuals affected by the breach within 30 days of the incident.

In a letter from Superintendent Javier Montaez to the Providence School Board on Sept. 25, the PPSD first used the term "unauthorized access" to refer to the breach, though the term "breach" was also used in the public statement that the Providence School Board issued on September 18.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is "encouraging" that the Providence school district is informing potentially affected employees and finalizing the credit monitoring contract as soon as possible, spokeswoman Anthony Vega said in an email sent to Rhode Island Current on Tuesday, that he received from the mayor.

It was reported in an e-mail sent by a spokesperson for the Providence City Council that the council would not be able to comment. Despite requests for comment, the governor's office did not get back to the Guardian with a response.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Despite repeated requests for comment from Rhode Island Current, Rogel has not responded to any of those requests.

There seemed to be a discrepancy between the school board president's use of the term "breach" and that of the district's official language which avoided stating the exact nature of the problem. The PPSD community was informed on Sept. 12 that the district's network had experienced "irregular activity," which ultimately led computer staff to cut off internet access to the district's offices and schools across the district.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is still a large lack of broadband availability in Providence schools, aside from a fleet of WiFi hotspots that are being deployed to provide connectivity in the absence of a main network.

There was a letter from PPSD to residents sent on Sept. 16 informing them that a forensic analysis was still being conducted and that no evidence had been found that PPSD data had been compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, Medusa appeared to claim credit for the "irregular activity" on Monday by posting a message to their publicly accessible ransom blog claiming 41 watermarked, sometimes partially obscured screenshots that preview the contents of the 201 gigabytes of data that the hackers claim to have stolen. The hackers also included identifying information — including serial numbers of employee cell phones and parent contact information — that helped identify the content of the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Medusa ransomware is an extremely dangerous malware that works quietly in the background after it has penetrated a system and accumulated exploitable data. Once the bounty has reached a sufficient amount, the database will encrypt the files to prevent users from accessing them. Ransom notes are then sent to victims demanding that they pay a ransom in exchange for the release of their files. There has also been a growing trend of "double extortion", where the hackers are not only stealing files but are also selling or releasing the data to the public if they do not receive payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A ransom page indicates that, in exchange for a payment of $1 million, PPSD can retrieve or delete its data. An additional day would be added to the timer if $100,000 was paid. Based on the hackers' countdown timer, the deadline for submitting the hack will be Sept. 25 in the morning.&nbsp;


Deloitte, however, released a report on Monday showing that state-level IT officials and security officers are unsure about the budgets that will be allocated to their state's telecommunications network infrastructure due to the uncertainty around it.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"The attack surface is increasing as state leaders become more reliant on information when it comes to operating government itself as the use of information is becoming more central," Srini Subramanian, a principal at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, told States Newsroom in an interview. Chief information security officers (CISOs) face an increasing number of challenges, and they have to make sure that the IT infrastructure survives ever-increasing cyber threats posed by hackers.

This difficulty was reflected in the survey results, which revealed that almost half of all respondents did not know their state's cybersecurity budget, which resulted from these challenges. Around 40% of state IT officers reported that they needed more money to comply with regulations or meet other legal requirements to comply with government regulations.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Those findings were confirmed this year by a report published by Moody's Ratings in 2023, which scores and analyzes municipal bonds. Robust cybersecurity practices can reduce exposure to threats to the enterprise, but initiatives that are difficult to implement and take resources away from core business functions may pose a credit challenge, according to Gregory Sobel, a Moody analyst and assistant vice president.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One study by Moody's also revealed that 92% of local governments have cyber insurance, an unprecedented two-fold increase over the last five years, according to Moody's. It is important to note that the popularity of this system did come with higher rates: a county in South Carolina went from paying a $70,000 premium in 2021 to a $210,000 premium in 2022 for this system. Aside from the higher costs, there are also stricter stipulations on risk management practices that need to be followed before a policy can be paid, such as better firewalls, consistent data backups, and multi-factor authentication, all of which make it difficult to get it to pay out.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During an email exchange with Rhode Island Current, Douglas W. Hubbard, CEO of Hubbard Decision Research, a consulting firm, and the author of “How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk,” informed the paper that schools should make use of the low-cost, free, or shared resources available to them to manage cyber risk more effectively.</div>

The company revealed the incident to the public on Monday, stating that the breach occurred between August 3 and August 6. Avis, which is part of the Avis Budget Group, sent notifications to affected customers last week, advising them on how to protect themselves from potential identity theft or fraud.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Avis Budget Group, which owns both Avis and Budget, operates over 10,000 rental locations across 180 countries, generating $12 billion in revenue in 2023, according to its most recent financial report. However, the recent data breach has cast a shadow over its operations, highlighting vulnerabilities in its data security measures. In a data breach notice filed with the Iowa Attorney General’s office, Avis disclosed that the compromised information includes customer names, dates of birth, mailing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, credit card details, and driver’s license numbers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A separate filing with the Maine Attorney General revealed that the data breach has impacted a total of 299,006 individuals so far. Texas has the highest number of affected residents, with 34,592 impacted, according to a report filed with the Texas Attorney General. The fact that sensitive personal information was stored in a manner that allowed it to be accessed by cybercriminals has raised serious questions about the company’s data protection practices.

Avis first became aware of the data breach on August 5 and took immediate steps to stop the unauthorized access to its systems.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The company stated that it had launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident and enlisted third-party security consultants to help identify the breach’s origins and scope. Avis has not yet disclosed specific details about the nature of the attack, the vulnerabilities exploited, or the identity of the perpetrators, leaving many questions unanswered.

This breach underscores the growing challenges faced by companies in protecting customer data in an increasingly digital world. While Avis acted quickly to contain the breach, the company’s reputation could suffer due to the extent of the data compromised and the sensitive nature of the information accessed.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The breach also serves as a reminder of the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, especially for businesses that handle large volumes of personal and financial data.

The incident has also prompted scrutiny from regulators and data privacy advocates. Many are questioning how sensitive customer information was stored and protected and why it was vulnerable to such an attack. Companies like Avis must ensure they are equipped with advanced security systems, encryption protocols, and regular audits to prevent such breaches from occurring in the future.

As the investigation continues, Avis customers are advised to monitor their financial accounts closely, watch for signs of identity theft, and take appropriate measures.</div>

This action occurred on the same day the platform released its recapture plan.

It was discovered that the perpetrator on Monday moved 2,500 Ether tokens worth about $6.3 million to Tornado Cash - a service that even blurs the origin of crypto assets - after attending the briefing session led by WazirX cofounder Nischal Shetty, who is based in Dubai.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In August, WazirX was hacked by an unknown group of hackers, who have remained unidentified since the heist took place in July and are reportedly moving the funds that have been stolen around. A recent piece of data collected by Arkham Research suggests that the hacker is using a controversial platform called Tornado Cash to commit his crimes.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A hacker who stole more than $230 million (roughly Rs. 1,900 crore) appears to have moved some $54.5 crore of Ether tokens worth of the stolen cryptocurrency $230 million into Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency platform that is now sanctioned by the United States government.

Using Tornado Cash, users can deposit their crypto tokens into a pool that contains various crypto tokens and then have their funds transferred to the destination wallet in the form of other cryptocurrencies after depositing their funds.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Over the past few years, Tornado Cash has become one of the most popular tools used by cybercriminals who want to let no evidence of their illicit activities trail them when transferring funds they have gained through illicit means.

As the data by Arkham shows, the hacker was able to facilitate 26 transactions through the use of his credentials to transfer the aforementioned amount to a Tornado Cash address.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, Etherscan data showed that the hacker moved the funds through various Bitcoin transactions, each carried out with 100 Ethereum units. 

It has been reported that social media users have been able to capture pictures of these details.

Data tracked by Arkham shows that the attacker moved nearly $4 million worth of ether [ETH] in 16 transactions through a Tornado Cash router, some of which were obtained through the Ethereum network.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This address is currently holding over $155 million worth of various tokens, with a majority of the funds being ether, which at $150 million has accumulated over the past few months.


On the other hand, WazirX recently revealed that, almost one week before the withdrawal window was supposed to open, users had begun to be able to withdraw up to 66% of their Indian rupee token balances from the exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the theft of funds, over 45% of the total reserves cited by the exchange in a June 2024 report have gone missing - and the exchange has since filed for a restructuring process to move forward on clearing its liabilities to recover the money.

In a statement on Monday, WazirX's legal advisers stated that it is unlikely that the company will be able to make good on its obligations in crypto terms going forward, with the best-case scenario being a refund of anywhere between 55% and 57%.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This attack is believed to have been conducted by Lazarus, a North Korean hacking unit, as previously reported by Reuters. It has been estimated that the group laundered over $1 billion in stolen funds through this service before OFAC sanctions were imposed in 2022, according to estimates put forward by the group.

Nischal Shetty, father of WazirX and co-founder of the company, confirmed that the hacker hasn't been identified yet.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking group that has been associated with North Korea for quite a while, has previously been alleged to have been involved in this hack.

Last week, WazirX initiated its first steps toward financial restructuring in the aftermath of the recent hacking incident. As part of this effort, the cryptocurrency exchange has filed for a moratorium in a Singapore court.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This legal action grants WazirX a reprieve, allowing it additional time to thoroughly assess its financial liabilities and reorganize its capital structure. The entire restructuring process is expected to take up to six months before it is fully completed.

In the interim, WazirX has reopened withdrawals for Indian Rupees (INR) on its platform.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The exchange is actively encouraging its users to withdraw 66 percent of their unfrozen INR balances, which have been made available for withdrawal at this stage. This measure is aimed at ensuring greater user security and providing liquidity during the ongoing restructuring phase.</div>

This might be the case because a lot of individuals found out about the news only after reading the stories they had missed over the weekend, or because third-party sources of app store intelligence take a little longer to report changes in rankings.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to Appfigures, an app intelligence company, Telegram didn't rise to the No. 2 spot on the Social Networking charts on the U.S. App Store until 3 a.m. EST on Monday, suggesting that the app is just now starting to gain traction. The app had already fallen to No. 3 in Social in the U.S. as of the time of publication, so it might only be a temporary boost.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, the app shot to the top of the App Store's Social Networking category and rose to become the third most popular app overall in France, the country where Durov was arrested. After climbing ten spots since Friday, Telegram now stands at No. 8 in the top apps chart (which does not include games). Appfigures stated that this is the highest position it has held here since at least January 1, 2023. Apple often uses a combination of measures, including download velocity and app install count, to determine app store rankings.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Nevertheless, the cliché "any press is good press" appears to hold true, at least in terms of Telegram's exposure on the App Store. As consumers downloaded the app out of curiosity — or possibly to support the founder's views about "free speech" — it began to rise in the rankings.</span></div></span>

Numerous attacks disrupt court operations and have broader implications, as they hurt employers who use public records to check their criminal records. Gaining a deeper understanding of the nature and impact of these cyberattacks reveals an urgent need to strengthen cybersecurity measures within the courts to safeguard sensitive information and maintain the public's trust in the system.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta, has also suffered a significant ransomware attack in late January and was similar in scope and impact to the one in California. It is claimed that the attack, which is attributed to the ransomware group LockBit, has caused a suspension of most government services, including the issuance of vehicle registrations, and marriage licenses, as well as the ability of the courts to process legal documents online.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a consequence, if the hacker's demands were not met by the government, they threatened to release sensitive data, including potentially high-profile information related to ongoing criminal investigations. Although Fulton County officials were threatened with such threats, they refused to pay the ransom and have been constantly working to restore services and systems across the county. As of more than a month after the hacking attack, some services have not been restored, showing the long-term impact of attacks like these on the operations of local governments and courts for years to come.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Georgia's largest county, hackers shut down office phone lines, left clerks unable to issue motor vehicle registrations or marriage licenses, and threatened to publically release sensitive data they claimed to have stolen if officials did not pay ransom. The county is currently in the process of repairing the damage that was inflicted on it a month ago by hackers.

This post is part of a series on the Ransomware syndicate LockBit, which took credit for a cyberattack that crippled the government services in Fulton County, which is the largest county in Atlanta and includes much of the city.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They started demanding payment from the residents, threatening to dump personal information as part of the data dump online if payment was not made. There is also a claim that the hackers were able to steal records relating to the criminal case against former President Donald Trump, which is pending at the moment.

Ransomware groups routinely steal data from victims before activating malware that encrypts networks before they activate it to maximize their chances of getting paid.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to some cybersecurity analysts, it doesn't appear that the Fulton County hackers had actual access to files related to Donald Trump.



Kansas Court System Breach

During October, the Kansas Office of Judicial Administration detected some unauthorized activity on its computers and networks, and immediately took action to protect its systems and data from any further harm. It was determined by the office and cybersecurity experts that some files were stolen after they were involved in the investigation of the incident.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the complexity of the data, it took until May to be able to determine the specific personal information that was affected or identified impacted individuals based on a manual review of the relevant data. Kansas courts began notifying victims in May, and the courts offered credit monitoring and identity recovery services to those who were affected.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Although reported breaches have generally been detected fairly quickly, it should be noted that recovery efforts have not yet been completed. It is with great regret to inform you that Kansas courts have enhanced their security measures in response to this incident to protect their networks and information systems even better.



After the Kansas judicial system was knocked offline for weeks in October by a cyberattack that involved the theft of personal information from about 150,000 people, the Kansas judicial system may have been breached and may have had their personal information stolen.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of an independent investigation conducted by a third party, the Office of Judicial Administration on Monday announced that it found evidence to support the cyberattack. Information that the office has accessed during this attack has been obtained through documents that have belonged to the office as a result of litigation appealed to the Kansas appellate court, applications made to the Kansas bar, and other documents.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is a possibility that information from any number of sources, such as social security numbers, driving licenses, government identification cards, credit card information, tax ID numbers, passport numbers, and information about health insurance policies, could have been accessed.

Cybersecurity threats posed by the federal government

In recent years, cyberattacks have become more common in the judicial system, and this is not a new issue. It was disclosed recently that two federal judges have issued warnings before a committee of the U.S.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The committee noted that the ageing database systems of the judiciary could be vulnerable to attacks, making a case for the need to upgrade them and increase funding for security measures. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy St. Eve, who chairs the Judicial Conference of the United States budget committee, has emphasized that the judiciary has suffered from a lack of investment for years, leaving it vulnerable as a result of continuing under-investment.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">U.S. District Judge Roslynn Mauskopf, serving as the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, has brought to attention a significant escalation in cyberattacks targeting the judiciary. Judge Mauskopf emphasized that these rising threats not only jeopardize the functioning of the justice system but also pose a broader danger to the integrity of democracy itself.

In response to this growing menace, the federal judiciary has sought $8.6 billion in discretionary funding for the fiscal year 2023, representing a 7.2% increase from the previous year.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This budget request includes a substantial allocation of $403 million specifically designated for IT security and modernization, as well as $786 million earmarked for court security. These figures underscore the heightened concerns regarding the safety of federal judges and courthouses. As cyber threats continue to advance in sophistication and frequency, it is anticipated that funding requests will persistently rise, particularly in critical areas such as IT security and court protection, to address ongoing challenges and support essential modernization initiatives.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While the federal judiciary can request significant funds to bolster its cybersecurity measures, state and local courts often operate under considerably tighter financial constraints. These courts, which are responsible for handling the majority of everyday legal proceedings, contain vast repositories of sensitive personal information. However, due to limited budgets, they may struggle to implement robust cybersecurity defences. This disparity highlights a critical issue: as cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, the need for cybersecurity investment is not confined to the federal level alone.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">State and local courts face substantial risks if they are unable to adequately protect their data, a vulnerability that could have far-reaching consequences for the justice system and undermine public trust.

The judiciary's role as custodian of some of the nation's most sensitive information makes cybersecurity an essential and urgent priority.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The testimonies of Judges St. Eve and Mauskopf underscore the critical need to modernize and safeguard vital judicial data. As cyberattacks continue to evolve, both federal and state judicial systems must prioritize cybersecurity measures to ensure the integrity of their operations and to maintain public confidence in the judicial process. Without adequate investment, particularly at the state and local levels, the judicial system may remain exposed to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, thereby endangering not only individual court cases but also the broader principles of justice and democracy.</div>

<p><img alt="Blog Telegram" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="600" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blog-Telegram.webp" tabindex="0" width="1200" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The arrest of Telegram's founder and CEO, Pavel Durov, on August 24, 2024, due to allegations that his messaging platform has been used for various illicit activities has sparked significant international attention and debate, particularly around issues of freedom of speech and the responsibilities of social media platforms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Conversely, the arrest has also incited the ire of several hacktivist groups in cyberspace because, for many in this community, Durov is more than just a tech entrepreneur; he is the mastermind behind two pivotal communication platforms in their lives: Vkontakte, Russia’s answer to Facebook, and the anonymous messaging app Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Vkontakte played a significant role in fostering communication and forming groups within hacktivist collectives. It was also a treasure trove of information for Russian hacktivists, thanks partly to its lax approach to copyright enforcement. Prior to Durov being forced to sell the platform, it was renowned for its virtually unmatched collection of illicit content.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Telegram later took on a similar role, providing a haven for pro-Russian hacktivists to organize, form communities, and sell services and software. With minimal moderation and Durov’s libertarian stance on privacy and free speech, hacktivist movements felt secure operating on Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Interestingly, Durov’s detention also sparked a rare moment of unity among unlikely allies: the Russian government, pro-Russian activists, and even members of the Russian opposition in exile. All three groups expressed skepticism toward the decision by French authorities, albeit in different ways.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While the Russian government and opposition followed the conventional route of issuing official statements, pro-Russian hacktivists quickly rallied to launch<a> #FreeDurov and #OpDurov </a>campaigns, signaling their support for Durov and Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FreeDurov and #OpDurov</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>News of Pavel Durov’s detention on Saturday evening, August 24, in France quickly spread like wildfire across Russian activists’ channels and chats on Telegram. Almost immediately, CRIL began monitoring the real-time reactions and activities of key Russian hacktivist groups and their allies:</p>

<li>Holy League (alliance)</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the first to react was the <strong>UserSec</strong> collective, which invited all other hacktivist groups to join the campaign against France. Several hacktivist alliances, such as the High Society and Holy League, shared these posts in their Telegram channels.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Two hours later, the group reported an attack on the Court of Cassation in France and the official website of the Administrative Court of Paris in conjunction with another infamous pro-Russian hacktivist group, the People's Cyber Army. People's Cyber Army administrators have been on the wanted list of criminals by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies since July 2024.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By Monday, August 26, several Russian and Pro-Russian hacktivist collectives, including Cyber Dragon, ReconSploit, Evilweb, Rootspolit, CGPlnet, and RipperSec, joined forces with UserSec and the People’s Cyber Army. Together, these groups launched coordinated <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/">cyber attacks</a> targeting various websites in France and organizations affiliated with the European Union.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The next day, August 27, 2024, UserSec continued its attacks on France, targeting the website of the French financial giant AXA Group.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":58251,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="UserSec and People's Cyber Army claim responsibility for the Attack on AXA France" class="wp-image-58251" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 4 - UserSec and People's Cyber Army claim responsibility for the Attack on AXA France</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Additionally, hacktivist groups simultaneously attacked a wide range of targets, including airports in Bayonne and Marseille-Provence, ferry services in Corsica, the website of a French customs agency, the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF), and other entities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Despite widespread claims of a massive cyber assault planned for the day of the court hearing, CRIL recorded diminished activities, with People’s Cyber Army claiming to access Industrial Control Systems (ICS) components of a French dam on August 28. To support their claim, they released a video showing their intrusion and the modifications made to the system settings. An examination of the video reveals that the People’s Cyber Army gained access to one of the Power transmission control panels developed by French company ELEC-ENR of the <strong>Parc éolien de Tenbonrev</strong>, a wind farm located in the Brittany region of France.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pavel Durov’s Border Crossing Details Emerge in Leaked FSB Database</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As we analyze the events surrounding Pavel Durov’s detention in Paris, it’s impossible to overlook the timing of a significant data leak involving Russia’s FSB Border Service database in mid-August 2024.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>During this period, information surfaced on one of the Telegram-based database leak channels, revealing details of individuals who crossed Russia’s borders between 2014 and 2023. The database, named “Kordon 2023”, where “Kordon” means “border” in Russian slang, contains sensitive information such as each traveler’s full name, the date and location of the border crossing, the mode of transportation used, and the destination.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, what stands out even more is that the leaked data contained records of Pavel Durov’s movements, a fact that directly contradicts his claims of having severed ties with Russia. The database revealed that Durov had traveled to Russia over 50 times since his immigration. Notably, he was in Russia on the very day that the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) announced their decision to list the ban from Telegram in Russia. Adding to the intrigue, the database mysteriously vanished shortly after its appearance, raising questions about who might have orchestrated this operation and for what purpose.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Several Russian investigative journalists have verified the authenticity and accuracy of this database.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The arrest of Pavel Durov and the subsequent legal measures imposed by the French court have sparked a significant surge in activity among both pro-Russian and other hacker groups. The #FreeDurov campaign has garnered support from not only pro-Palestinian factions but also various French teams and numerous other collectives. Telegram has become the primary platform for these groups to push their nefarious campaigns.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Also, these incidents highlight a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over the responsibilities of social media platforms in regulating content while upholding user privacy. The backlash from various factions underscores a collective apprehension about the implications of legal actions against tech leaders. As the situation develops, privacy advocates will be closely monitoring how these events may reshape the landscape of digital communication and the protections afforded to users in an increasingly regulated online environment. The outcome of Durov's case could set a precedent that either reinforces or undermines the principles of privacy and free speech that many Telegram users hold dear.</p>
