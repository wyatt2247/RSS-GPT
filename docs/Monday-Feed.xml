<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicXhKPpi5M8mm788GvhH_3cF7hOOK6i3ye2vJUG3FhyLNcnKuC0oqJsI-gE8njf6eXQnIzASk9pLjkh31aQWKdTfS-1C8XL4bpFc9BcaZrK_6l3uCjPGjarF4E_p5rg5vWdnJdEZZFhRJBSf1f1jfRTaOb3rBobAxdUxPH0ybxGHOrTDZa5OZoOLF_2sra/s5913/pexels-sora-shimazaki-5668772.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="410" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicXhKPpi5M8mm788GvhH_3cF7hOOK6i3ye2vJUG3FhyLNcnKuC0oqJsI-gE8njf6eXQnIzASk9pLjkh31aQWKdTfS-1C8XL4bpFc9BcaZrK_6l3uCjPGjarF4E_p5rg5vWdnJdEZZFhRJBSf1f1jfRTaOb3rBobAxdUxPH0ybxGHOrTDZa5OZoOLF_2sra/w640-h410/pexels-sora-shimazaki-5668772.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">Due to the sophistication of cyber threats, cybercriminals target judicial systems more often, exposing significant vulnerabilities. Numerous attacks disrupt court operations and have broader implications, as they hurt employers who use public records to check their criminal records. Gaining a deeper understanding of the nature and impact of these cyberattacks reveals an urgent need to strengthen cybersecurity measures within the courts to safeguard sensitive information and maintain the public's trust in the system.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta, has also suffered a significant ransomware attack in late January and was similar in scope and impact to the one in California. It is claimed that the attack, which is attributed to the ransomware group LockBit, has caused a suspension of most government services, including the issuance of vehicle registrations, and marriage licenses, as well as the ability of the courts to process legal documents online.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a consequence, if the hacker's demands were not met by the government, they threatened to release sensitive data, including potentially high-profile information related to ongoing criminal investigations. Although Fulton County officials were threatened with such threats, they refused to pay the ransom and have been constantly working to restore services and systems across the county. As of more than a month after the hacking attack, some services have not been restored, showing the long-term impact of attacks like these on the operations of local governments and courts for years to come.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Georgia's largest county, hackers shut down office phone lines, left clerks unable to issue motor vehicle registrations or marriage licenses, and threatened to publically release sensitive data they claimed to have stolen if officials did not pay ransom. The county is currently in the process of repairing the damage that was inflicted on it a month ago by hackers.

This post is part of a series on the Ransomware syndicate LockBit, which took credit for a cyberattack that crippled the government services in Fulton County, which is the largest county in Atlanta and includes much of the city.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They started demanding payment from the residents, threatening to dump personal information as part of the data dump online if payment was not made. There is also a claim that the hackers were able to steal records relating to the criminal case against former President Donald Trump, which is pending at the moment.

Ransomware groups routinely steal data from victims before activating malware that encrypts networks before they activate it to maximize their chances of getting paid.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to some cybersecurity analysts, it doesn't appear that the Fulton County hackers had actual access to files related to Donald Trump.



Kansas Court System Breach

During October, the Kansas Office of Judicial Administration detected some unauthorized activity on its computers and networks, and immediately took action to protect its systems and data from any further harm. It was determined by the office and cybersecurity experts that some files were stolen after they were involved in the investigation of the incident.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the complexity of the data, it took until May to be able to determine the specific personal information that was affected or identified impacted individuals based on a manual review of the relevant data. Kansas courts began notifying victims in May, and the courts offered credit monitoring and identity recovery services to those who were affected.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Although reported breaches have generally been detected fairly quickly, it should be noted that recovery efforts have not yet been completed. It is with great regret to inform you that Kansas courts have enhanced their security measures in response to this incident to protect their networks and information systems even better.



After the Kansas judicial system was knocked offline for weeks in October by a cyberattack that involved the theft of personal information from about 150,000 people, the Kansas judicial system may have been breached and may have had their personal information stolen.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result of an independent investigation conducted by a third party, the Office of Judicial Administration on Monday announced that it found evidence to support the cyberattack. Information that the office has accessed during this attack has been obtained through documents that have belonged to the office as a result of litigation appealed to the Kansas appellate court, applications made to the Kansas bar, and other documents.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There is a possibility that information from any number of sources, such as social security numbers, driving licenses, government identification cards, credit card information, tax ID numbers, passport numbers, and information about health insurance policies, could have been accessed.

Cybersecurity threats posed by the federal government

In recent years, cyberattacks have become more common in the judicial system, and this is not a new issue. It was disclosed recently that two federal judges have issued warnings before a committee of the U.S.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The committee noted that the ageing database systems of the judiciary could be vulnerable to attacks, making a case for the need to upgrade them and increase funding for security measures. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy St. Eve, who chairs the Judicial Conference of the United States budget committee, has emphasized that the judiciary has suffered from a lack of investment for years, leaving it vulnerable as a result of continuing under-investment.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">U.S. District Judge Roslynn Mauskopf, serving as the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, has brought to attention a significant escalation in cyberattacks targeting the judiciary. Judge Mauskopf emphasized that these rising threats not only jeopardize the functioning of the justice system but also pose a broader danger to the integrity of democracy itself.

In response to this growing menace, the federal judiciary has sought $8.6 billion in discretionary funding for the fiscal year 2023, representing a 7.2% increase from the previous year.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This budget request includes a substantial allocation of $403 million specifically designated for IT security and modernization, as well as $786 million earmarked for court security. These figures underscore the heightened concerns regarding the safety of federal judges and courthouses. As cyber threats continue to advance in sophistication and frequency, it is anticipated that funding requests will persistently rise, particularly in critical areas such as IT security and court protection, to address ongoing challenges and support essential modernization initiatives.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While the federal judiciary can request significant funds to bolster its cybersecurity measures, state and local courts often operate under considerably tighter financial constraints. These courts, which are responsible for handling the majority of everyday legal proceedings, contain vast repositories of sensitive personal information. However, due to limited budgets, they may struggle to implement robust cybersecurity defences. This disparity highlights a critical issue: as cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, the need for cybersecurity investment is not confined to the federal level alone.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">State and local courts face substantial risks if they are unable to adequately protect their data, a vulnerability that could have far-reaching consequences for the justice system and undermine public trust.

The judiciary's role as custodian of some of the nation's most sensitive information makes cybersecurity an essential and urgent priority.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The testimonies of Judges St. Eve and Mauskopf underscore the critical need to modernize and safeguard vital judicial data. As cyberattacks continue to evolve, both federal and state judicial systems must prioritize cybersecurity measures to ensure the integrity of their operations and to maintain public confidence in the judicial process. Without adequate investment, particularly at the state and local levels, the judicial system may remain exposed to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, thereby endangering not only individual court cases but also the broader principles of justice and democracy.</div>

<p><img alt="Blog Telegram" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="600" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blog-Telegram.webp" tabindex="0" width="1200" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The arrest of Telegram's founder and CEO, Pavel Durov, on August 24, 2024, due to allegations that his messaging platform has been used for various illicit activities has sparked significant international attention and debate, particularly around issues of freedom of speech and the responsibilities of social media platforms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Conversely, the arrest has also incited the ire of several hacktivist groups in cyberspace because, for many in this community, Durov is more than just a tech entrepreneur; he is the mastermind behind two pivotal communication platforms in their lives: Vkontakte, Russia’s answer to Facebook, and the anonymous messaging app Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Vkontakte played a significant role in fostering communication and forming groups within hacktivist collectives. It was also a treasure trove of information for Russian hacktivists, thanks partly to its lax approach to copyright enforcement. Prior to Durov being forced to sell the platform, it was renowned for its virtually unmatched collection of illicit content.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Telegram later took on a similar role, providing a haven for pro-Russian hacktivists to organize, form communities, and sell services and software. With minimal moderation and Durov’s libertarian stance on privacy and free speech, hacktivist movements felt secure operating on Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Interestingly, Durov’s detention also sparked a rare moment of unity among unlikely allies: the Russian government, pro-Russian activists, and even members of the Russian opposition in exile. All three groups expressed skepticism toward the decision by French authorities, albeit in different ways.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While the Russian government and opposition followed the conventional route of issuing official statements, pro-Russian hacktivists quickly rallied to launch<a> #FreeDurov and #OpDurov </a>campaigns, signaling their support for Durov and Telegram.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">FreeDurov and #OpDurov</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>News of Pavel Durov’s detention on Saturday evening, August 24, in France quickly spread like wildfire across Russian activists’ channels and chats on Telegram. Almost immediately, CRIL began monitoring the real-time reactions and activities of key Russian hacktivist groups and their allies:</p>

<li>Holy League (alliance)</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One of the first to react was the <strong>UserSec</strong> collective, which invited all other hacktivist groups to join the campaign against France. Several hacktivist alliances, such as the High Society and Holy League, shared these posts in their Telegram channels.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Two hours later, the group reported an attack on the Court of Cassation in France and the official website of the Administrative Court of Paris in conjunction with another infamous pro-Russian hacktivist group, the People's Cyber Army. People's Cyber Army administrators have been on the wanted list of criminals by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies since July 2024.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By Monday, August 26, several Russian and Pro-Russian hacktivist collectives, including Cyber Dragon, ReconSploit, Evilweb, Rootspolit, CGPlnet, and RipperSec, joined forces with UserSec and the People’s Cyber Army. Together, these groups launched coordinated <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/">cyber attacks</a> targeting various websites in France and organizations affiliated with the European Union.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The next day, August 27, 2024, UserSec continued its attacks on France, targeting the website of the French financial giant AXA Group.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":58251,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="UserSec and People's Cyber Army claim responsibility for the Attack on AXA France" class="wp-image-58251" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 4 - UserSec and People's Cyber Army claim responsibility for the Attack on AXA France</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Additionally, hacktivist groups simultaneously attacked a wide range of targets, including airports in Bayonne and Marseille-Provence, ferry services in Corsica, the website of a French customs agency, the Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF), and other entities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Despite widespread claims of a massive cyber assault planned for the day of the court hearing, CRIL recorded diminished activities, with People’s Cyber Army claiming to access Industrial Control Systems (ICS) components of a French dam on August 28. To support their claim, they released a video showing their intrusion and the modifications made to the system settings. An examination of the video reveals that the People’s Cyber Army gained access to one of the Power transmission control panels developed by French company ELEC-ENR of the <strong>Parc éolien de Tenbonrev</strong>, a wind farm located in the Brittany region of France.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pavel Durov’s Border Crossing Details Emerge in Leaked FSB Database</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As we analyze the events surrounding Pavel Durov’s detention in Paris, it’s impossible to overlook the timing of a significant data leak involving Russia’s FSB Border Service database in mid-August 2024.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>During this period, information surfaced on one of the Telegram-based database leak channels, revealing details of individuals who crossed Russia’s borders between 2014 and 2023. The database, named “Kordon 2023”, where “Kordon” means “border” in Russian slang, contains sensitive information such as each traveler’s full name, the date and location of the border crossing, the mode of transportation used, and the destination.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, what stands out even more is that the leaked data contained records of Pavel Durov’s movements, a fact that directly contradicts his claims of having severed ties with Russia. The database revealed that Durov had traveled to Russia over 50 times since his immigration. Notably, he was in Russia on the very day that the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) announced their decision to list the ban from Telegram in Russia. Adding to the intrigue, the database mysteriously vanished shortly after its appearance, raising questions about who might have orchestrated this operation and for what purpose.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Several Russian investigative journalists have verified the authenticity and accuracy of this database.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The arrest of Pavel Durov and the subsequent legal measures imposed by the French court have sparked a significant surge in activity among both pro-Russian and other hacker groups. The #FreeDurov campaign has garnered support from not only pro-Palestinian factions but also various French teams and numerous other collectives. Telegram has become the primary platform for these groups to push their nefarious campaigns.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Also, these incidents highlight a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over the responsibilities of social media platforms in regulating content while upholding user privacy. The backlash from various factions underscores a collective apprehension about the implications of legal actions against tech leaders. As the situation develops, privacy advocates will be closely monitoring how these events may reshape the landscape of digital communication and the protections afforded to users in an increasingly regulated online environment. The outcome of Durov's case could set a precedent that either reinforces or undermines the principles of privacy and free speech that many Telegram users hold dear.</p>
