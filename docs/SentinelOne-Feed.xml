<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders that, as of August 2024, a group of Iran-based cyber actors continues to exploit U.S. and foreign organizations. This includes organizations across several sectors in the U.S. (including in the education, finance, healthcare, and defense sectors as well as local government entities) and other countries (including in Israel, Azerbaijan, and the United Arab Emirates). The FBI assesses a significant percentage of these threat actors’ operations against US organizations are intended to obtain and develop network access to then collaborate with ransomware affiliate actors to deploy ransomware. The FBI further assesses these Iran-based cyber actors are associated with the Government of Iran (GOI) and—separate from the ransomware activity—conduct computer network exploitation activity in support of the GOI (such as intrusions enabling the theft of sensitive technical data against organizations in Israel and Azerbaijan).</p>
<p>This CSA provides the threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs), as well as highlights similar activity from a previous advisory (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-259a" title="Iran-Based Threat Actor Exploits VPN Vulnerabilities">Iran-Based Threat Actor Exploits VPN Vulnerabilities</a>) that the FBI and CISA published on Sept. 15, 2020. The information and guidance in this advisory are derived from FBI investigative activity and technical analysis of this group’s intrusion activity against U.S. organizations and engagements with numerous entities impacted by this malicious activity.</p>
<p>The FBI recommends all organizations follow guidance provided in the <strong>Mitigations</strong> section of this advisory to defend against the Iranian cyber actors’ activity.</p>
<p>If organizations believe they have been targeted or compromised by the Iranian cyber actors, the FBI and CISA recommend immediately contacting your <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices" title="Field Offices">local FBI field office</a> for assistance and/or reporting the incident via CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/report" title="Report to CISA">Incident Reporting Form</a> (see the <strong>Reporting&nbsp;</strong>section of this advisory for more details and contact methods).</p>
<p>For more information on Iran state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/advanced-persistent-threats/iran" title="Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories">Iran Cyber Threat</a> webpage.</p>

<h2><strong>Threat Actor Details</strong></h2>
<h3>Background on Threat Group and Prior Activity</h3>
<p>This advisory outlines activity by a specific group of Iranian cyber actors that has conducted a high volume of computer network intrusion attempts against U.S. organizations since 2017 and as recently as August 2024. Compromised organizations include U.S.-based schools, municipal governments, financial institutions, and healthcare facilities. This group is known in the private sector by the names Pioneer Kitten, Fox Kitten, UNC757, Parisite, RUBIDIUM, and Lemon Sandstorm.[<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/groups/G0117/" title="Fox Kitten">1</a>][<a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-pioneer-kitten/" title="Who Is PIONEER KITTEN?">2</a>] The actors also refer to themselves by the moniker Br0k3r, and as of 2024, they have been operating under the moniker “xplfinder” in their channels. FBI analysis and investigation indicate the group’s activity is consistent with a cyber actor with Iranian state-sponsorship.</p>
<p>The FBI previously observed these actors attempt to monetize their access to victim organizations on cyber marketplaces. A significant percentage of the group’s US-focused cyber activity is in furtherance of obtaining and maintaining technical access to victim networks to enable future ransomware attacks. The actors offer full domain control privileges, as well as domain admin credentials, to numerous networks worldwide. More recently, the FBI identified these actors collaborating directly with ransomware affiliates to enable encryption operations in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments. These actors have collaborated with the ransomware affiliates NoEscape[<a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/noescape/" title="NoEscape Ransomware: In-Depth Analysis, Detection, and Mitigation">3</a>], Ransomhouse[<a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/ransomhouse/" title="RansomHouse Ransomware: In-Depth Analysis, Detection, and Mitigation">4</a>], and ALPHV (aka BlackCat) (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-353a" title="#StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat">#StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat</a>). The Iranian cyber actors’ involvement in these ransomware attacks goes beyond providing access; they work closely with ransomware affiliates to lock victim networks and strategize on approaches to extort victims. The FBI assesses these actors do not disclose their Iran-based location to their ransomware affiliate contacts and are intentionally vague as to their nationality and origin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the FBI has historically observed this actor conduct hack-and-leak campaigns, such as the late 2020 campaign known as Pay2Key.[<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/software/S0556/" title="Pay2Key">5</a>],[<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/ransomware-alert-pay2key/" title="Ransomware Alert: Pay2Key">6</a>] The actors operated a <code>.onion</code> site (reachable through the Tor browser) hosted on cloud infrastructure registered to an organization previously compromised by the actors. (The actors created the server leveraging their prior access to this victim.)&nbsp;Following the compromise and the subsequent unauthorized acquisition of victim data, the actors publicized news of their compromise (including on social media), tagging accounts of victim and media organizations, and leaking victim data on their <code>.onion</code> site. While this technique has traditionally been used to influence victims to pay ransoms, the FBI does not believe the objective of Pay2Key was to obtain ransom payments. Rather, the FBI assesses Pay2Key was an information operation aimed at undermining the security of Israel-based cyber infrastructure.</p>
<h3>Attribution Details</h3>
<p>FBI investigation identified that the Iranian cyber actors conduct malicious cyber activity, which FBI assessed to be in support of the GOI. The FBI judges this activity to be separate from the previously referenced ransomware-enabling activity. This group directs their activity towards countries and organizations consistent with Iranian state interests, and typically not of interest to the group’s ransomware affiliate contacts, such as U.S. defense sector networks, and those in Israel, Azerbaijan, United Arab Emirates. Instead, it is intended to steal sensitive information from these networks, suggesting the group maintains an association with the GOI. However, the group’s ransomware activities are likely not sanctioned by the GOI, as the actors have expressed concern for government monitoring of cryptocurrency movement associated with their malicious activity.</p>
<p>The group uses the Iranian company name Danesh Novin Sahand (identification number 14007585836), likely as a cover IT entity for the group’s malicious cyber activities.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Details</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This advisory uses the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/matrices/enterprise/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK<sup>®</sup></a><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/matrices/enterprise/" title="Enterprise Matrix"> Matrix for Enterprise</a> framework, version 15.1. See the <strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactics and Techniques</strong> section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques.

<h3>Overview of Observed Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures</h3>
<p>The Iranian cyber actors’ initial intrusions rely upon exploits of remote external services on internet-facing assets to gain initial access to victim networks. As of July 2024, these actors have been observed scanning IP addresses hosting Check Point Security Gateways, probing for devices potentially vulnerable to CVE-2024-24919. As of April 2024, these actors have conducted mass scanning of IP addresses hosting Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS and GlobalProtect VPN devices. The actors were likely conducting reconnaissance and probing for devices vulnerable to CVE-2024-3400. Historically, this group has exploited organizations by leveraging CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2023-3519 related to Citrix Netscaler, and CVE-2022-1388 related to BIG-IP F5 devices.</p>
<h3>Reconnaissance, Initial Access, Persistence, and Credential Access</h3>
<p>The actors have been observed using the Shodan search engine to identify and enumerate IP addresses that host devices vulnerable to a particular CVE. The actors’ initial access is usually obtained via exploiting a public-facing networking device, such as Citrix Netscaler (CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2023-3519), F5 BIG-IP (CVE-2022-1388), Pulse Secure/Ivanti VPNs (CVE-2024-21887), and, more recently, PanOS firewalls (CVE-2024-3400) [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1596/" title="Search Open Technical Databases">T1596</a>][<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1190/" title="Exploit Public-Facing Application">T1190</a>].</p>
<p>Following exploitation of vulnerable devices, the actors use the following techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture login credentials using webshells on compromised Netscaler devices and append to file named <code>netscaler.1</code> in the same directory as the webshell [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1505/003/" title="Server Software Component: Web Shell">T1505.003</a>][<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1056/" title="Input Capture">T1056</a>].</li>
<li>Create the directory <code>/var/vpn/themes/imgs/</code> on Citrix Netscaler devices to deploy a webshell [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1505/003/" title="Server Software Component: Web Shell">T1505.003</a>]. Malicious files deployed to this directory include:
<ul>
<li><code>netscaler.1</code></li>
<li><code>netscaler.php</code></li>
<li><code>ctxHeaderLogon.php</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specifically related to Netscaler, place additional webshells on compromised devices immediately after system owners patch the exploited vulnerability [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1505/003/" title="Server Software Component: Web Shell">T1505.003</a>]. The following file locations and filenames have been observed on devices:
<ul>
<li><code>/netscaler/logon/LogonPoint/uiareas/ui_style.php</code></li>
<li><code>/netscaler/logon/sanpdebug.php&nbsp;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create the directory <code>/xui/common/images/</code> on targeted IP addresses [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1133/">T1133</a>].</li>
<li>Create accounts on victim networks; observed names include “sqladmin$,” “adfsservice,” “IIS_Admin,” “iis-admin,” and “John McCain” [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1136/" title="Create Account">T1136.001</a>].</li>
<li>Request exemptions to the zero-trust application and security policies for tools they intend to deploy on a victim network [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1098/" title="Account Manipulation">T1098</a>].</li>
<li>Create malicious scheduled task SpaceAgentTaskMgrSHR in <code>Windows/Spaceport/</code> task folder. This task uses a DLL side-loading technique against the signed Microsoft SysInternals executable <code>contig.exe</code>, which may be renamed to <code>dllhost.ext</code>, to load a payload from version.dll. This file has been observed being executed from the Windows Downloads directory [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1053/" title="Scheduled Task/Job">T1053</a>].&nbsp;</li>
<li>Place a malicious backdoor version.dll in <code>C:\Windows\ADFS\</code> directory [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1505/003/" title="Server Software Component: Web Shell">T1505.003</a>].</li>
<li>Use a scheduled task to load malware through installed backdoors [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1053/" title="Scheduled Task/Job">T1053</a>].</li>
<li>Deployment of Meshcentral to connect with compromised servers for remote access [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1219/" title="Remote Access Software">T1219</a>].</li>
<li>For persistence and as detection and mitigation occurs, the actors create a daily Windows service task with random eight characters and attempt execution of a similarly named DLL contained in the <code>C:\Windows\system32\drivers</code>\ directory. For example, a service named “test” was observed attempting to load a file located at <code>C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\test.sys</code> [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1505/" title="Server Software Component">T1505</a>].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Execution, Privilege Escalation, and Defense Evasion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Repurpose compromised credentials from exploiting networking devices, such as Citrix Netscaler, to log into other applications (i.e., Citrix XenDesktop) [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1078/003/" title="Valid Accounts: Local Accounts">T1078.003</a>].</li>
<li>Repurpose administrative credentials of network administrators to log into domain controllers and other infrastructure on victim networks [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1078/002/" title="Valid Accounts: Domain Accounts">T1078.002</a>].</li>
<li>Use administrator credentials to disable antivirus and security software, and lower PowerShell policies to a less secure level [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1562/001/" title="Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools">T1562.001</a>][<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1562/010/" title="Impair Defenses: Downgrade Attack">T1562.010</a>].</li>
<li>Attempt to enter security exemption tickets to the network security device or contractor to get the actor’s tools allowlisted <a>[</a><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1562/001/" title="Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools">T1562.001</a>].</li>
<li>Use a compromised administrator account to initiate a remote desktop session to another server on the network. In one instance, the FBI observed this technique being used to attempt to start Microsoft Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripted Environment (ISE) to run the command “Invoke-WebRequest” with a URI including <code>files.catbox[.]moe</code>. Catbox is a free, online file hosting site the actors use as a repository/hosting mechanism [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1059/001/" title="Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell">T1059.001</a>].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<ul>
<li>Export system registry hives and network firewall configurations on compromised servers [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1012/" title="Query Registry">T1012</a>].</li>
<li>Exfiltrate account usernames from the victim domain controller, as well as access configuration files and logs—presumably to gather network and user account information for use in further exploitation efforts [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1482/" title="Domain Trust Discovery">T1482</a>].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Command and Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install “AnyDesk” remote access program as a backup access method [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1219/" title="Remote Access Software">T1219</a>].</li>
<li>Enable servers to use Windows PowerShell Web Access [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1059/001/" title="Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell">T1059.001</a>].</li>
<li>Use the open source tunneling tool Ligolo (ligolo/ligolo-ng) [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1572/" title="Protocol Tunneling">T1572</a>].</li>
<li>Use NGROK (ngrok[.]io) deployment to create outbound connections to a random subdomain [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1572/" title="Protocol Tunneling">T1572</a>].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exfiltration and Impact</h3>
<p>After infiltrating victim networks, the actors collaborate with ransomware affiliates (including NoEscape, Ransomhouse, and ALPHV [aka BlackCat]) in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments by providing affiliates with access to victim networks, locking victim networks, and strategizing to extort victims <a>[</a><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/techniques/T1657/" title="Financial Theft">T1657</a>]. The actors also conduct what is assessed to be separate set of malicious activity—stealing sensitive data from victims [<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v15/tactics/TA0010/" title="Exfiltration">TA0010</a>], likely in support of the GOI.</p>

<h2><strong>Indicators of Compromise</strong></h2>
<h3>IP Address and Domain Identifiers</h3>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The IP addresses and domains listed in <strong>Table 10</strong> were observed in use by the actors in the specified timeframes in 2024. The authoring agencies recommend organizations investigate or vet these IP addresses prior to taking action, such as blocking.</p>
<p><strong>Comment:&nbsp;</strong>In addition to the infrastructure provided in the table below, the FBI and CISA warn that these actors are known to leverage information obtained through intrusions into cloud-computing resources associated with victim organizations. The actors have used this cloud infrastructure to conduct further cyber operations targeting other organizations. The FBI observed use of this tradecraft against U.S. academic and defense sectors, but it could theoretically be used against any organization. The FBI and CISA warn that if these actors compromised your organization, they may be leveraging your cloud services accounts to conduct malicious cyber activity and target other victims. The FBI has observed instances of the actors using compromised cloud service accounts to transmit data stolen from other compromised organizations.</p>

<h3>Actor Identifiers</h3>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The FBI observed the following identifiers associated with the Iranian cyber group and their ransomware affiliates. The FBI is providing this information to enable improved threat actor identification and tracking of malicious cyber activity. Please see <strong>Appendix A</strong> for list of TOX identifiers.</p>
<p>The FBI observed the threat actors to be associated with the following bitcoin address values:</p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Mitigations</strong></h2>
<p>The FBI and CISA recommend all organizations implement the mitigations listed below to improve their cybersecurity posture based on the Iranian cyber group’s activity. The FBI judges the group’s targeting is primarily based on the identification of devices vulnerable to CVEs named in this notification (see <strong>Technical Details</strong> section for a list of CVEs). As such, any U.S. organization deploying software with these vulnerabilities may be targeted for further exploitation and should follow this guidance to defend against exploitation by this group.</p>
<p>These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals" title="Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals">Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals</a> for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.</p>
<p>The FBI and CISA recommend all organizations implement the following mitigations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review available logs for IP addresses in <strong>Table 10</strong> for indications of traffic with your organization’s network in the provided timeframes [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A" title="Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)">CPG 3.A</a>]. The indicators in Table 11 should also be reviewed to identify historical activity or incidents which may have previously been identified by your organization.</li>
<li>Apply patches and/or mitigations for CVE-2024-3400, CVE-2022-1388, CVE-2019-19781, and CVE-2023-3519 [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#MitigatingKnownVulnerabilities1E" title="Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities (1.E)">CPG 1.E</a>].
<ul>
<li>Be advised, patching for the above referenced CVEs may be insufficient to mitigate malicious activity if your network has already been compromised by these actors while the network device was vulnerable. Additional investigation into the use of stolen credentials (e.g., via the webshell on Netscaler devices) is strongly encouraged to identify threat actor attempts to establish footholds on other parts of the network [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A" title="Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)">CPG 3.A</a>].</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check your systems for the unique identifiers and TTPs used by the actors when operating on compromised networks, including creation of specific usernames, use of NGROK and Ligolo, and deployment of webshells in specific directories [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A" title="Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)">CPG 3.A</a>].</li>
<li>Check your systems for outbound web requests to <code>files.catbox[.]moe</code> and <code>***.ngrok[.]io</code> [<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals#DetectingRelevantThreatsandTTPs3A" title="Detecting Relevant Threats and TTPs (3.A)">CPG 3.A</a>].</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Validate Security Controls</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. The authoring agencies recommend testing your existing security controls inventory to assess how they perform against the ATT&amp;CK techniques described in this advisory.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select an ATT&amp;CK technique described in this advisory (see <strong>Table 2</strong> to <strong>Table 10</strong>).</li>
<li>Align your security technologies against the technique.</li>
<li>Test your technologies against the technique.</li>
<li>Analyze your detection and prevention technologies’ performance.</li>
<li>Repeat the process for all security technologies to obtain a set of comprehensive performance data.</li>
<li>Tune your security program, including people, processes, and technologies, based on the data generated by this process.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2>
<p>Your organization has no obligation to respond or provide information back to the FBI in response to this joint advisory. If, after reviewing the information provided, your organization decides to provide information to the FBI, reporting must be consistent with applicable state and federal laws.</p>
<h3>Ransomware Incidents</h3>
<p>The FBI and CISA are interested in any information that can be shared in the case of a ransomware incident, to include boundary logs showing communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with threat actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file.</p>
<p>Additional details of interest include a targeted company point of contact, status and scope of infection, estimated loss, operational impact, transaction IDs, date of infection, date detected, initial attack vector, and host- and network-based indicators.</p>
<p>The FBI and CISA do not encourage paying ransom as payment does not guarantee victim files will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI’s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Home/ComplaintChoice" title="Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3)">Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3)</a>, your <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices" title="Field Offices">local FBI Field Office</a>, or CISA via the agency’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/report" title="Report to CISA">Incident Reporting Form</a> or its 24/7 Operations Center (<a href="mailto:report@cisa.gov)" title="Report to CISA">report@cisa.gov</a>), or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).</p>
<h3>Other Incidents</h3>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/top.png" /></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A few days ago, we came across a peculiar file. It looked like some kind of builder, and a quick glance at the settings piqued our interest. It appeared to be a ShadowPad builder, probably created around 2021.</p>

<p>ShadowPad builders became a topic of conversation around the time of the i-Soon leak, but we had never seen the actual builder ourselves. This is likely true for most of you as well.</p>

<p>We were so intrigued that we carefully investigated this builder and reviewed past attack campaigns. In this article, we will share how attackers build ShadowPad, what we discovered through our investigation, and our insights.</p>

<p>Our investigation is still ongoing. We would love to engage in active discussions with you. If you have any opinions or comments, please feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>[Note] What we discovered this time is a builder. It does not include a controller. Therefore, it is not possible to control what is generated by this builder. In other words, this builder alone is not meaningful in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In June 2024, we happened to read a research memo from a year ago. We often read past memos for a change of pace. In doing so, we recalled an attack on Kyrgyzstan in April 2023.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/1.png" /></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/nao_sec/status/1648960199938707456">https://x.com/nao_sec/status/1648960199938707456</a></p>

<p>This attack involved a file resembling a RoyalRoad RTF, which prompted our investigation at the time. Opening this RTF file with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Word displayed a decoy file related to Kyrgyzstan’s cybersecurity, while simultaneously writing and executing several files to the disk. As a result, a CobaltStrike beacon was executed.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/2.png" /></p>

<p>The loader that decrypted and executed the beacon resembled Casper Loader. Casper Loader is familiar to threat researchers specializing in East Asia and has been reported to be used in attacks by Tick<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="http://nao-sec.org/2024/06/building-caspers-shadow.html#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="http://nao-sec.org/2024/06/building-caspers-shadow.html#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Our friend @aRtAGGI conducted similar analyses at the time.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/3.png" /></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/aRtAGGI/status/1649184131090087938">https://x.com/aRtAGGI/status/1649184131090087938</a></p>

<p>We later found that a similar attack had been carried out against Kazakhstan after searching our past database. The attack on Kazakhstan was older than the one on Kyrgyzstan, occurring around November 2022. In this case, the same loader executed from the RTF file eventually ran the CobaltStrike beacon.</p>

<p>Information about the RTF files used in the attacks on Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan is listed in the IoC sheet from our previous research on RoyalRoad RTF<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="http://nao-sec.org/2024/06/building-caspers-shadow.html#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote" href="http://nao-sec.org/2024/06/building-caspers-shadow.html#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. We have identified these as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">U-4</code>. If you are interested, please refer to the IoC sheet.</p>

<p><a href="https://nao-sec.org/jsac2020_ioc.html">https://nao-sec.org/jsac2020_ioc.html</a></p>

<p>Let’s return to the present. To investigate recent attack samples, we executed a search query based on the characteristics of the loader used in the attack on Kyrgyzstan.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>exports:IEE2 exports:LoadLibraryShim2 exports:LoadStringRC2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We found an unusual file posted in May 2024. This data was embedded in the resource section of another file. We downloaded and executed the original file. To our surprise, it was a ShadowPad builder.</p>

<p>When launching the ShadowPad builder, which calls itself CasperVMakerHTTPx86, the following screen appears. There are several tabs, each with various settings.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Install</li>
  <li>Inject</li>
  <li>Online</li>
  <li>Proxy</li>
  <li>DNS</li>
</ul>

<p>These items are very similar to the reported architecture of ShadowPad<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote" href="http://nao-sec.org/2024/06/building-caspers-shadow.html#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. This suggests that these tabs are configuration items for each module. The settings for each item are as follows:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/6.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/7.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/8.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/9.png" /></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/10.png" /></p>

<p>Let’s try building ShadowPad. By clicking the “Build EXE x86” button, ShadowPad is generated. If the build is successful, an EXE file and a DLL file are created.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/11.png" /></p>

<p>The EXE file is a legitimate AppLaunch. It loads the mscoree.dll in the same directory via DLL Side-Loading. The DLL file is the Casper Loader, which decodes and executes the ShadowPad shellcode stored internally.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/12.png" /></p>

<h2 id="comparison-with-similar-samples">Comparison with Similar Samples</h2>
<p>ShadowPad loaders exhibit several patterns, but those generated using this builder are decoded using a custom XOR with constants.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/13.png" /></p>

<p>There are many samples with similar characteristics, but we will introduce two of them.</p>

<h3 id="sample-1">Sample-1</h3>
<p>According to Macnica’s report<sup id="fnref:2:1"><a class="footnote" href="http://nao-sec.org/2024/06/building-caspers-shadow.html#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, Tick uses Casper Loader to execute ShadowPad. Comparing this Casper Loader with the loader created using the builder reveals that while the Macnica sample contains junk code and different fixed values, the algorithm is the same.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/14.png" /></p>

<h3 id="sample-2">Sample-2</h3>
<p>A report released by the FBI in December 2021<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote" href="http://nao-sec.org/2024/06/building-caspers-shadow.html#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> reported an attack exploiting CVE-2021-44515 where ShadowPad was used. The AppLaunch.exe and mscoree.dll in this case used Casper Loader to execute ShadowPad.</p>

<p>Comparing this Casper Loader with the one created using the builder shows that the algorithm and fixed values are identical. Although API Hashing is not used, it is a highly similar sample.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/15.png" /></p>

<h2 id="shadowpad-community">ShadowPad Community</h2>
<p>As you know, ShadowPad is commercial software sold for profit.

These can be broadly categorized into two groups: attack groups associated with the MSS, like APT41, and those associated with the PLA, like Tick.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, it is generally believed that whg and Rose were involved in ShadowPad’s development. There is no compelling reason to refute this, so we will proceed with this assumption. According to a U.S. government report related to APT41<sup id="fnref:39"><a class="footnote" href="http://nao-sec.org/2024/06/building-caspers-shadow.html#fn:39" rel="footnote">39</a></sup>, Rose (Tan Dailin) was involved in APT41. Seven individuals were indicted for their involvement with APT41, with Rose (and Zhang Haoran) being particularly noted for their involvement in both BARIUM and LEAD, making them key figures in APT41’s activities. This background suggests that BARIUM was the earliest adopter of ShadowPad, followed by LEAD.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/16.png" /></p>

<p>In contrast, the PLA has many more attack groups using ShadowPad than the MSS. This is generally because many researchers have given them different names, and their relationships are not sufficiently organized. If you are a researcher, you probably have more organized information in your mind (or within your organization). Of course, we understand and accept this. However, to keep things simple, we will exclude such discussions in this article and share how we organized this information within nao_sec. Interestingly, all these attack groups used the RoyalRoad RTF Weaponizer. Is this just a coincidence? ShadowPad and RoyalRoad RTF Weaponizer may be shared through the same channels.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://nao-sec.org/assets/2024-07-01/17.png" /></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we introduced the ShadowPad builder. ShadowPad, widely used by various targeted attack groups as a successor to PlugX, had limited information available about its builder until now. This article sheds light on how attackers build ShadowPad.</p>

<p>We also organized the relationships between attack groups using ShadowPad. Our research is still ongoing. We would love to engage in active discussions. If you have any opinions or comments, please contact us. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
