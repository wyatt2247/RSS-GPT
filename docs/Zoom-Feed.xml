It is becoming increasingly common to abuse Spotify playlists and podcasts to promote pirated software, cheat codes for video games, spam links, and "warez" websites.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">To spam Spotify web player results into search engines such as Google, threat actors can inject targeted keywords and links in the description and title of playlists and podcasts to boost SEO for their dubious online properties.

In these listings, there are playlist names, podcast description titles, and bogus "episodes," which encourage listeners to visit external links that link to places that might cause a security breach.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A significant number of threat actors exploit Google's Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) to boost the search engine ranking of their illicit websites that promote spam, torrents, and pirated content by manipulating search engine rankings.

According to BleepingComputer, one of the methods used in the SEO poisoning attack is Google's datastudio.google.com subdomain, which appears to lend credibility to the malicious website.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Aside from mass email spam campaigns, spammers are also using Audible podcasts as another means to spread the word about their illicit activities.

Spam can be sent to any digital platform that is open to the public, and no digital platform is immune to that. In cases such as those involving Spotify or Amazon, there is an interesting aspect that is, one would instinctively assume that the overhead associated with podcasting and digital music distribution would deter spammers, who would otherwise have to turn to low-hanging fruit, like writing spammy posts to social media or uploading videos that have inaccurate descriptions on YouTube.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The most recent instance of this was a Spotify playlist entitled "Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack...", which seemed to drive traffic to several "free" software sites listed in the title and description of the playlist.

Karol Paciorek, a cybersecurity enthusiast who spotted the playlist, said, "Cybercriminals exploit Spotify for malware distribution because Spotify has become a prominent tool for distributing malware. Why? Because Spotify's tracks and pages are easily indexed by search engines, making it a popular location for creating malicious links.".&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The newest business intelligence tool from Google, Looker Studio (formerly, Google Data Studio) is a web-based tool that allows users to make use of data to create customizable reports and dashboards allowing them to visualize and analyze their data.

A Data Studio application can, and has been used in the past, to track and visualize the download counts of open source packages over some time, such as four weeks, for a given period.



There are many legitimate business cases for Looker Studio, but like any other web service, it may be misused by malicious actors looking to host questionable content on illegal domains or manipulate search engine results for illicit URLs.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Recent SEO poisoning campaigns have been seen targeting keywords related to the U.S. midterm election, as well as pushing malicious Zoom, TeamViewer, and Visual Studio installers to targeted sites.&nbsp;

Firstory is open to publishing podcasts on Spotify, but it acknowledges that spam is an ongoing issue that it is increasingly trying to address, as it focuses on curtailing it as much as possible.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Spam accounts and misleading content remain persistent challenges for digital platforms, according to Stanley Yu, co-founder of Firstory, in a statement provided to BleepingComputer. Yu emphasized that addressing these issues is an ongoing priority for the company.

To tackle the growing threat of unauthorized and spammy content, Firstory has implemented a multifaceted approach. This includes active collaboration with major streaming platforms to detect and remove infringing material swiftly.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The company has also developed and employed advanced technologies to scan podcast titles and show notes for specific keywords associated with spam, ensuring early identification and mitigation of potential violations. Furthermore, Firstory proactively monitors and blocks suspicious email addresses commonly used by malicious actors to infiltrate and disrupt digital ecosystems.

By integrating technology-driven solutions with strategic partnerships, Firstory aims to set a higher standard for content integrity across platforms.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The company’s commitment reflects a broader industry imperative to protect users and maintain trust in an ever-expanding digital landscape.

They have, however, become a prime target for malicious actors attempting to exploit flaws, impacting both individual users and companies.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Despite efforts to boost security, several of these extensions have found ways to exploit vulnerabilities in Google's latest extension framework, Manifest V3 (MV3). SquareX's recent research explained how these rogue extensions can continue to evade crucial security protections, exposing millions of users to risks such as data theft, malware, and unauthorised access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Google has always had troubles with Chrome addons. In June 2023, the company had to manually remove 32 vulnerable extensions that had been installed 72 million times before being removed.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Google's previous extension framework, Manifest Version 2 (MV2), was notoriously unstable. It frequently granted excessive rights to extensions and allowed scripts to be introduced without user knowledge, making it less complicated for cybercriminals to steal data, access sensitive information, and install malware.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">In response, Google launched Manifest V3, which intended to improve security by limiting permissions and requiring extensions to declare their scripts in advance. While MV3 was supposed to address the vulnerabilities found in MV2, SquareX's study indicates that it falls short in important areas.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Malicious extensions built on MV3 can still circumvent security measures and grab live video streams from collaboration services such as Google Meet and Zoom Web without requiring specific permission. They can even add unauthorised contributors to private GitHub repositories and send users to phishing pages masquerading as password managers.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Furthermore, these malicious extensions, like their MV2 counterparts, can access browser history, cookies, bookmarks, and download history by displaying a fake software update pop-up that dupes users into downloading the malware.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Once the malicious extension is installed, individuals and businesses are unable to notice its activity, leaving them vulnerable. Endpoint protection, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), and Secure Web Gateways (SWG) are examples of security solutions that cannot dynamically assess potential risks in browser extensions.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">SquareX has created a number of solutions targeted at enhancing browser extension security in order to address these issues. Their strategy includes customised rules that let administrators choose which extensions to accept or ban depending on user ratings, reviews, update history, and extension permissions.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">This system can prevent network requests from extensions in real time using policies, machine learning insights, and heuristic analysis. Additionally, SquareX is experimenting with dynamic analysis of Chrome extensions using a customised Chromium browser on its cloud server, which will provide greater insights into the behaviour of potentially malicious extensions.</span></div></span>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <p><img alt="PTZ Cameras" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" height="600" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cyble-Blogs-PTZ-Cameras.png" title="Critical Vulnerabilities in PTZ Cameras: CISA Adds New Exploits to Its Catalog 2" width="1200" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recently added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog, spotlighting security flaws in <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/11/04/cisa-adds-two-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The vulnerabilities, which affect specific PTZOptics camera models, pose a considerable risk to organizations that rely on these devices for surveillance, live streaming, and conference automation.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These flaws could be leveraged by malicious actors to execute OS command injections or bypass authentication controls, exposing sensitive systems to potential breaches.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vulnerabilities in PTZOptics Cameras: CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities—CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957—affect the PT30X-SDI/NDI series of PTZ cameras from PTZOptics. These devices, which are also embedded in various white-label AV equipment, are vulnerable to critical security flaws that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary commands. Here's an overview of each vulnerability:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>CVE-2024-8956: Authentication Bypass Vulnerability</strong></li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>CVSS Score</strong>: 9.1 (Critical)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This authentication bypass vulnerability affects the PTZOptics PT30X-SDI and PT30X-NDI-xx-G2 cameras running versions prior to 6.3.40. Due to improper authorization, attackers can remotely access the cameras without <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-is-a-part-of-your-cyber-hygiene/">authentication</a>. This allows them to leak sensitive data, including usernames, password hashes, and device configuration details. Additionally, attackers can modify or overwrite the configuration files, compromising the system's integrity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: The vulnerability provides attackers with the ability to access critical configuration files and potentially disrupt operations by altering camera settings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>2. CVE-2024-8957: OS Command Injection Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>CVSS Score</strong>: 9.8 (Critical)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This OS command injection vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of the ntp_addr configuration value in the PTZOptics cameras. When the ntp_client service is started, the flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices. When combined with the previous authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-8956), an attacker could leverage both vulnerabilities to perform even more damaging actions, such as executing malicious commands remotely.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: Attackers can exploit this flaw to compromise the camera’s operating system, potentially allowing them to gain full control over the device and even spread their attack within a network.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CISA’s Action: Immediate Attention Required</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>PTZ cameras are widely used across various industries for surveillance, broadcasting, and remote monitoring, making them a prime target for cybercriminals. The authentication bypass vulnerability and OS command injection vulnerability in these cameras represent frequent attack vectors for malicious <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/">cyber actors</a>, who often exploit such flaws to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate sensitive data, or even take control of critical systems.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Organizations that utilize PTZ cameras in their infrastructure are strongly advised to patch these vulnerabilities immediately to mitigate potential security risks. The vulnerabilities disclosed in PTZOptics cameras are part of a broader trend of vulnerabilities in Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, which have increasingly become targets for attackers due to their prevalence in critical systems. OS command injection vulnerabilities and authentication bypass vulnerabilities in cameras expose organizations to severe security risks, especially when these devices are connected to the internet without proper safeguards.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>PTZ cameras, like many IoT devices, often operate with limited built-in security measures. These devices typically have embedded software and firmware that can be vulnerable to attack, especially when manufacturers fail to release timely security updates. Additionally, the growing use of white-label AV equipment based on third-party camera firmware further complicates the security landscape, as these devices may not receive adequate vendor support.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Both CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957 are acknowledged by ValueHD Corporation, the vendor behind the PTZOptics camera models. The company has released a <a href="https://ptzoptics.com/firmware-changelog/">patch</a> for the affected camera models to address these vulnerabilities. Customers using PTZOptics PT30X-SDI and PTZOptics PT30X-NDI-xx-G2 cameras should immediately upgrade to version 6.3.40 or later to prevent exploitation.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Recommendations and Mitigating for PTZ Camera Vulnerabilities</strong><strong></strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To address the risks by vulnerabilities in PTZ cameras, organizations should implement several best practices to protect their systems from potential exploitation:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>As soon as a vendor releases a patch addressing critical vulnerabilities like authentication bypass or OS command injection, organizations should prioritize its installation. Delays in patching can expose devices to active attacks.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Critical devices, including PTZ cameras, should not be exposed directly to the internet. Organizations should segment their networks to isolate critical assets and use <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-firewall/">firewalls</a> and access controls to limit exposure.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Implementing a patch management process that includes inventory management, patch assessment, testing, and deployment can help ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner across the entire infrastructure.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Organizations should have a clear and tested <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-incident-response/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="incident response plan">incident response plan</a> in place to quickly detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vulnerabilities in PTZOptics Cameras: CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities—CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957—affect the PT30X-SDI/NDI series of PTZ cameras from PTZOptics. These devices, which are also embedded in various white-label AV equipment, are vulnerable to critical security flaws that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary commands. Here's an overview of each vulnerability:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>CVE-2024-8956: Authentication Bypass Vulnerability</strong></li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>CVSS Score</strong>: 9.1 (Critical)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This authentication bypass vulnerability affects the PTZOptics PT30X-SDI and PT30X-NDI-xx-G2 cameras running versions prior to 6.3.40. Due to improper authorization, attackers can remotely access the cameras without <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-is-a-part-of-your-cyber-hygiene/">authentication</a>. This allows them to leak sensitive data, including usernames, password hashes, and device configuration details. Additionally, attackers can modify or overwrite the configuration files, compromising the system's integrity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: The vulnerability provides attackers with the ability to access critical configuration files and potentially disrupt operations by altering camera settings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><strong>2. CVE-2024-8957: OS Command Injection Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>CVSS Score</strong>: 9.8 (Critical)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This OS command injection vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of the ntp_addr configuration value in the PTZOptics cameras. When the ntp_client service is started, the flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices. When combined with the previous authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-8956), an attacker could leverage both vulnerabilities to perform even more damaging actions, such as executing malicious commands remotely.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: Attackers can exploit this flaw to compromise the camera’s operating system, potentially allowing them to gain full control over the device and even spread their attack within a network.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>PTZ cameras are widely used across various industries for surveillance, broadcasting, and remote monitoring, making them a prime target for cybercriminals. The authentication bypass vulnerability and OS command injection vulnerability in these cameras represent frequent attack vectors for malicious <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/">cyber actors</a>, who often exploit such flaws to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate sensitive data, or even take control of critical systems.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Organizations that utilize PTZ cameras in their infrastructure are strongly advised to patch these vulnerabilities immediately to mitigate potential security risks. The vulnerabilities disclosed in PTZOptics cameras are part of a broader trend of vulnerabilities in Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, which have increasingly become targets for attackers due to their prevalence in critical systems. OS command injection vulnerabilities and authentication bypass vulnerabilities in cameras expose organizations to severe security risks, especially when these devices are connected to the internet without proper safeguards.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>PTZ cameras, like many IoT devices, often operate with limited built-in security measures. These devices typically have embedded software and firmware that can be vulnerable to attack, especially when manufacturers fail to release timely security updates. Additionally, the growing use of white-label AV equipment based on third-party camera firmware further complicates the security landscape, as these devices may not receive adequate vendor support.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Both CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957 are acknowledged by ValueHD Corporation, the vendor behind the PTZOptics camera models. The company has released a <a href="https://ptzoptics.com/firmware-changelog/">patch</a> for the affected camera models to address these vulnerabilities. Customers using PTZOptics PT30X-SDI and PTZOptics PT30X-NDI-xx-G2 cameras should immediately upgrade to version 6.3.40 or later to prevent exploitation.</p>

In addition to these impersonations, Marko Polo even fabricates its own brand names like VDeck, Wasper, and SpectraRoom to lure unsuspecting users. The Marko Polo operation is highly versatile, capable of infecting both Windows and macOS platforms. On Windows, they use a tool called “HijackLoader” to deliver malware like Stealc, designed to extract data from browsers, and Rhadamanthys, which targets a wide array of applications and data types.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Rhadamanthys has also added advanced features, such as a cryptocurrency clipper to redirect payments to the attackers’ wallets, and the ability to evade Windows Defender.

When it comes to macOS, the group deploys Atomic (AMOS), an infostealer launched in 2023, which they rent out to cybercriminals for $1,000 per month. AMOS is highly effective at extracting sensitive data stored on macOS systems, such as Apple Keychain passwords, MetaMask seeds, WiFi credentials, credit card details, and other encrypted information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Marko Polo campaign’s widespread nature highlights the dangers of information-stealing malware, and users need to be vigilant against unsolicited links and downloads from unknown sources. One of the most effective ways to protect against such malware is to download software exclusively from official websites and ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date. This ensures the detection of malicious payloads before they can compromise your system.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Information-stealing malware campaigns are becoming increasingly common, with Marko Polo’s operation serving as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics cybercriminals employ today. These stolen credentials often enable hackers to breach corporate networks, engage in data theft, and disrupt business operations. Therefore, cybersecurity awareness and strong preventive measures are crucial for protecting against such malicious activities.

<p>Notably, the suspicious domain linked to the ScreenConnect installation resolves to an IP address that also hosts another domain involved in scamming Social Security Administration (SSA) account holders. A Facebook user highlighted this connection in a post, revealing the same infrastructure used for multiple scams targeting different groups. This indicates a broader operation where the same network is used to perpetrate various types of fraud. In the figure below, readers can see the Zoom phishing site in question.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How The Scam Works</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The scam often begins with a phishing email, text, or call, claiming to be from a trusted source (e.g., Amazon, PayPal, or even government agencies). The scammer informs the victim of an urgent issue like a compromised account, refund, or technical support problem. The scammer instructs the victim to call a fake tech support number or click on a link present in the spam email. They pose as a legitimate support representative and claim to help resolve the issue.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the victim engages, the scammer asks them to install remote desktop software such as <strong>ScreenConnect</strong>, allowing the scammer to take control of the victim's computer under the guise of "fixing" the problem. After gaining remote access, the scammer can view the victim's desktop, manipulate files, and gain access to sensitive information ranging from bank accounts and passwords to personal data. With control of the computer, scammers may initiate fraudulent transactions, ask for payment in the form of gift cards or cryptocurrency, or transfer funds directly from the victim's bank accounts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In 2023, CISA released an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-025a">advisory</a> warning about a scam where scammers contacted users through spam emails, pretending to be from Geek Squad regarding subscription renewals. The email included a customer service phone number, instructing recipients to call if they did not authorize the charge or wanted to cancel and request a refund.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When victims called, the scammers convinced them to download ScreenConnect software, giving them remote access to the victims' computers. With this access, the scammers manipulated the bank account summary to falsely show that an excess refund had been issued. They then pressured the victims into "returning" the supposed overpayment, which was sent directly to the scammers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The victim never actually received any extra money in their bank account—it just appeared that way because the scammer manipulated the screen. Once the victim sends the "refund," they’re effectively sending their own money to the scammer, who will then disappear.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campaign Analysis</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this campaign, it is suspected that the scammers will convince victims to download <strong>ScreenConnect</strong> software via a Zoom-themed phishing site. The downloaded binary “Private-Meeting.ClientSetup.exe” is a 32-bit binary containing five PE files in the resource section, with some filenames suggesting the installation of ScreenConnect software.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":57891,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-57891" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-2-Embedded-resources.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 2 - Embedded resources</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When the victim runs the binary, it extracts an MSI installer from the resource section and saves it in the temporary directory. The binary then reads the digital signature from the main executable, signs this signature to the installer file, and uses <em>msiexec.exe</em> to install ScreenConnect on the system. This process is designed to make the installation appear legitimate.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ScreenConnect client is then launched, connecting to the specified domain “<em>poyttwq[.]zapto[.]org”</em> on port 8041, as shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>The server at “poyttwq.zapto[.]org” is hosted on IP address “79.110.49[.]157,” which also hosts the website “railindiaticket[.]in.” This site displays a page with the ConnectWise icon, the title “Support,” and prompts users to enter a secure code to continue, suggesting that the website is involved in a scam related to ConnectWise.</p>

<p>During our investigation of this scam website, we uncovered a social media post in which a user reported receiving an email from “support@railindiaticket[.]in,” falsely claiming to be from Social Security Administration (SSA) support. The email urged the recipient to download an application. Based on this post, we suspect that the scammer behind this campaign is targeting SSA account holders and attempting to trick them into installing software such as ConnectWise.</p>

<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is a U.S. government agency responsible for administering Social Security, a government program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible Americans. The SSA issues Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are used to track earnings and benefits for individuals throughout their lives.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On August 7th, the Office of the Inspector General (SSA) issued a scam alert <a href="https://oig.ssa.gov/assets/uploads/scam-alert-hybrid-scams-on-the-rise_08-07-2024.pdf">advisory</a>, warning about scammers escalating their tactics by using fake Amazon or PayPal tech support emails and text messages. These messages aim to connect victims with individuals impersonating Social Security Administration (SSA) employees, who then attempt to convince the targets that their Social Security number (SSN) or record has been compromised.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Scammers use a "long-con" approach and then pass the victim to an imposter pretending to be an SSA agent, exploiting detailed personal information to build trust. This scheme often culminates in the victim handing over valuables or currency during a staged in-person meeting with someone involved in the scam. This method, known as "<a href="https://cyble.com/blog/the-spreading-wave-of-pig-butchering-scams-in-india/">pig butchering</a>," is designed to deplete the victim’s resources.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By leveraging a fake Zoom-themed website and digitally signed binaries, the scammers successfully masked the installation of ScreenConnect software as a legitimate process. The use of ScreenConnect, a widely recognized remote desktop application, further aided in the deception, allowing the scammers to gain unauthorized access to victims' systems under the guise of providing support. This same infrastructure is used for multiple fraudulent activities, including scams targeting Social Security Administration (SSA) account holders. This phishing campaign exemplifies the increasingly sophisticated methods cybercriminals are using to deceive victims into compromising their own systems.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recommendations</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Social Security Administration (SSA) typically contacts beneficiaries through official channels, not unsolicited emails or phone calls. If you receive a suspicious message, do not click on links or provide personal information.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>If you're unsure about the legitimacy of a communication, contact SSA directly through their official website or customer service number, not the contact information provided in the suspicious message.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>SSA will never ask you to download software or applications via email or text. If you receive a request like this, it is likely a scam.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Always verify website URLs to ensure they belong to the legitimate SSA domain (e.g., <a href="http://www.ssa.gov">www.ssa.gov</a>). Scammers may use slight variations in URLs to deceive victims.</li>
