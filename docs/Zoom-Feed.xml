<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vulnerabilities in PTZOptics Cameras: CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities—CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957—affect the PT30X-SDI/NDI series of PTZ cameras from PTZOptics. These devices, which are also embedded in various white-label AV equipment, are vulnerable to critical security flaws that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary commands. Here's an overview of each vulnerability:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li><strong>CVE-2024-8956: Authentication Bypass Vulnerability</strong></li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>CVSS Score</strong>: 9.1 (Critical)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This authentication bypass vulnerability affects the PTZOptics PT30X-SDI and PT30X-NDI-xx-G2 cameras running versions prior to 6.3.40. Due to improper authorization, attackers can remotely access the cameras without <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/multi-factor-authentication-mfa-is-a-part-of-your-cyber-hygiene/">authentication</a>. This allows them to leak sensitive data, including usernames, password hashes, and device configuration details. Additionally, attackers can modify or overwrite the configuration files, compromising the system's integrity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: The vulnerability provides attackers with the ability to access critical configuration files and potentially disrupt operations by altering camera settings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>2. CVE-2024-8957: OS Command Injection Vulnerability</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>CVSS Score</strong>: 9.8 (Critical)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: This OS command injection vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of the ntp_addr configuration value in the PTZOptics cameras. When the ntp_client service is started, the flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices. When combined with the previous authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-8956), an attacker could leverage both vulnerabilities to perform even more damaging actions, such as executing malicious commands remotely.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong>: Attackers can exploit this flaw to compromise the camera’s operating system, potentially allowing them to gain full control over the device and even spread their attack within a network.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CISA’s Action: Immediate Attention Required</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>PTZ cameras are widely used across various industries for surveillance, broadcasting, and remote monitoring, making them a prime target for cybercriminals. The authentication bypass vulnerability and OS command injection vulnerability in these cameras represent frequent attack vectors for malicious <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/">cyber actors</a>, who often exploit such flaws to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate sensitive data, or even take control of critical systems.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Organizations that utilize PTZ cameras in their infrastructure are strongly advised to patch these vulnerabilities immediately to mitigate potential security risks. The vulnerabilities disclosed in PTZOptics cameras are part of a broader trend of vulnerabilities in Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras, which have increasingly become targets for attackers due to their prevalence in critical systems. OS command injection vulnerabilities and authentication bypass vulnerabilities in cameras expose organizations to severe security risks, especially when these devices are connected to the internet without proper safeguards.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>PTZ cameras, like many IoT devices, often operate with limited built-in security measures. These devices typically have embedded software and firmware that can be vulnerable to attack, especially when manufacturers fail to release timely security updates. Additionally, the growing use of white-label AV equipment based on third-party camera firmware further complicates the security landscape, as these devices may not receive adequate vendor support.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Both CVE-2024-8956 and CVE-2024-8957 are acknowledged by ValueHD Corporation, the vendor behind the PTZOptics camera models. The company has released a <a href="https://ptzoptics.com/firmware-changelog/">patch</a> for the affected camera models to address these vulnerabilities. Customers using PTZOptics PT30X-SDI and PTZOptics PT30X-NDI-xx-G2 cameras should immediately upgrade to version 6.3.40 or later to prevent exploitation.</p>

There is no doubt that the movie focuses on data and privacy, but humans are social animals and they need someone to listen to them, guide them, or be there as they go through life.&nbsp;

The CEO of Microsoft AI, Mustafa Suleyman, spoke about this recently in a CNBC interview.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During an interview with CNN, Suleyman explained that the company is engineering AI companions to watch "what we are doing and to remember what we are doing." This will create a close relationship between AI and humans.

As a result of the announcement of AI assistants for the workplace, many companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google have come up with such solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It has been announced by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that Windows will be launching a new feature called Recall. A semantic search is more than just a keyword search; it digs deep into users' digital history to recreate moments from the past, tracking them back to the time they happened.

It was announced today by Microsoft's AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, that Copilot, the company's artificial intelligence assistant, has been redesigned.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Copilot, a newly revamped version of Microsoft's most popular AI companion, shares the same vision of a companion for AI that will revolutionize the way users interact with technology daily in their day-to-day lives with the AI head.
After joining Microsoft earlier this year, after the company strategically hired key staff from Inflection AI, Suleyman wrote a 700-word memo describing what he refers to as a "technological paradigm shift."&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Copilot has been redesigned to create an AI experience that is more personalized and supportive, similar to Inflection AI's Pi product, which adapts to users' requirements over time, similar to the Pi product.

The announcement of AI assistants for the workplace has been made by a number of companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google.&nbsp;

The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella explained that "Recall is not just about documents." in an interview.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A sophisticated AI model embedded directly inside the device begins to take screenshots of users' activity and then feeds the data collected into an on-board database that analyzes these activities. By using neural processing technology, all images and interactions can be made searchable, even going as far as searching images by themselves.

There are some concerns regarding the events, with Elon Musk warning in a characteristic post that this is akin to an episode of Black Mirror. Going to turn this 'feature' off in the future."&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">OpenAI has introduced the ChatGPT desktop application, now powered by the latest GPT-4o model, which represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence technology.

Using techniques such as spear-phishing, malvertising, and brand impersonation, the group spreads over 50 malware payloads, including AMOS, Stealc, and Rhadamanthys, across different sectors like gaming, cryptocurrency, and software.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, Marko Polo’s campaigns have compromised thousands of devices globally, posing a significant threat to consumer privacy and business security, with potential financial losses in the millions. The group primarily uses spear-phishing tactics via direct messages on social media, targeting high-value individuals like cryptocurrency influencers, gamers, and software developers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They impersonate popular brands such as Fortnite, Zoom, and RuneScape, creating fake job offers and project collaborations to deceive victims into downloading malware. In addition to these impersonations, Marko Polo even fabricates its own brand names like VDeck, Wasper, and SpectraRoom to lure unsuspecting users. The Marko Polo operation is highly versatile, capable of infecting both Windows and macOS platforms. On Windows, they use a tool called “HijackLoader” to deliver malware like Stealc, designed to extract data from browsers, and Rhadamanthys, which targets a wide array of applications and data types.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Rhadamanthys has also added advanced features, such as a cryptocurrency clipper to redirect payments to the attackers’ wallets, and the ability to evade Windows Defender.

When it comes to macOS, the group deploys Atomic (AMOS), an infostealer launched in 2023, which they rent out to cybercriminals for $1,000 per month. AMOS is highly effective at extracting sensitive data stored on macOS systems, such as Apple Keychain passwords, MetaMask seeds, WiFi credentials, credit card details, and other encrypted information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Marko Polo campaign’s widespread nature highlights the dangers of information-stealing malware, and users need to be vigilant against unsolicited links and downloads from unknown sources. One of the most effective ways to protect against such malware is to download software exclusively from official websites and ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date. This ensures the detection of malicious payloads before they can compromise your system.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Information-stealing malware campaigns are becoming increasingly common, with Marko Polo’s operation serving as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics cybercriminals employ today. These stolen credentials often enable hackers to breach corporate networks, engage in data theft, and disrupt business operations. Therefore, cybersecurity awareness and strong preventive measures are crucial for protecting against such malicious activities.

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Cyble Research and Intelligence Labs (CRIL) has uncovered a phishing site designed to mimic Zoom, which facilitates the download of <strong>ScreenConnect</strong> software.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Scammers are leveraging Zoom's trusted reputation to trick victims into downloading ScreenConnect. By impersonating a widely recognized platform, the phishing site increases the likelihood that victims will believe the download is legitimate, lowering their guard.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>This ScreenConnect software allows attackers to establish a remote connection to the victim’s computer, giving them full access to the system.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The IP address associated with the ScreenConnect software is also linked to other malicious activities. Notably, it hosts a domain involved in scamming <strong>Social Security Administration (SSA)</strong> account holders, indicating that the same scammers are running multiple scams from the same infrastructure.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Another aspect of this campaign involves spam emails falsely claiming to come from SSA support. These emails target SSA account holders, urging them to download an application supposedly to stay updated on their account status.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble Research &amp; Intelligence Labs (CRIL) has identified a phishing website designed to impersonate Zoom. This fraudulent site tricks users into downloading ScreenConnect software. Once installed, ScreenConnect connects to a suspicious domain, giving unauthorized access to the victim’s computer. This access allows attackers to take control of affected machines and proceed to carry out further malicious activities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Notably, the suspicious domain linked to the ScreenConnect installation resolves to an IP address that also hosts another domain involved in scamming Social Security Administration (SSA) account holders. A Facebook user highlighted this connection in a post, revealing the same infrastructure used for multiple scams targeting different groups. This indicates a broader operation where the same network is used to perpetrate various types of fraud. In the figure below, readers can see the Zoom phishing site in question.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":57890,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-57890" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-1-Phishing-site-1.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1 - Phishing site</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How The Scam Works</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The scam often begins with a phishing email, text, or call, claiming to be from a trusted source (e.g., Amazon, PayPal, or even government agencies). The scammer informs the victim of an urgent issue like a compromised account, refund, or technical support problem. The scammer instructs the victim to call a fake tech support number or click on a link present in the spam email. They pose as a legitimate support representative and claim to help resolve the issue.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the victim engages, the scammer asks them to install remote desktop software such as <strong>ScreenConnect</strong>, allowing the scammer to take control of the victim's computer under the guise of "fixing" the problem. After gaining remote access, the scammer can view the victim's desktop, manipulate files, and gain access to sensitive information ranging from bank accounts and passwords to personal data. With control of the computer, scammers may initiate fraudulent transactions, ask for payment in the form of gift cards or cryptocurrency, or transfer funds directly from the victim's bank accounts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In 2023, CISA released an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-025a">advisory</a> warning about a scam where scammers contacted users through spam emails, pretending to be from Geek Squad regarding subscription renewals. The email included a customer service phone number, instructing recipients to call if they did not authorize the charge or wanted to cancel and request a refund.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When victims called, the scammers convinced them to download ScreenConnect software, giving them remote access to the victims' computers. With this access, the scammers manipulated the bank account summary to falsely show that an excess refund had been issued. They then pressured the victims into "returning" the supposed overpayment, which was sent directly to the scammers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The victim never actually received any extra money in their bank account—it just appeared that way because the scammer manipulated the screen. Once the victim sends the "refund," they’re effectively sending their own money to the scammer, who will then disappear.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campaign Analysis</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this campaign, it is suspected that the scammers will convince victims to download <strong>ScreenConnect</strong> software via a Zoom-themed phishing site. The downloaded binary “Private-Meeting.ClientSetup.exe” is a 32-bit binary containing five PE files in the resource section, with some filenames suggesting the installation of ScreenConnect software.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":57891,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-57891" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-2-Embedded-resources.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 2 - Embedded resources</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When the victim runs the binary, it extracts an MSI installer from the resource section and saves it in the temporary directory. The binary then reads the digital signature from the main executable, signs this signature to the installer file, and uses <em>msiexec.exe</em> to install ScreenConnect on the system. This process is designed to make the installation appear legitimate.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":57892,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-57892" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-3-Code-snippet-handling-the-installation-of-ScreenConnect.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 3 - Code snippet handling the installation of ScreenConnect</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ScreenConnect client is then launched, connecting to the specified domain “<em>poyttwq[.]zapto[.]org”</em> on port 8041, as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":57894,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-57894" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-4-ScreenConnect-client-execution-command.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 4 - ScreenConnect client execution command</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The server at “poyttwq.zapto[.]org” is hosted on IP address “79.110.49[.]157,” which also hosts the website “railindiaticket[.]in.” This site displays a page with the ConnectWise icon, the title “Support,” and prompts users to enter a secure code to continue, suggesting that the website is involved in a scam related to ConnectWise.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":57895,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-57895" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-5-–-Scam-website-prompting-to-enter-secure-code-1024x477.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 5 – Scam website prompting to enter secure code</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>During our investigation of this scam website, we uncovered a social media post in which a user reported receiving an email from “support@railindiaticket[.]in,” falsely claiming to be from Social Security Administration (SSA) support. The email urged the recipient to download an application. Based on this post, we suspect that the scammer behind this campaign is targeting SSA account holders and attempting to trick them into installing software such as ConnectWise.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":57896,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-57896" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-6-Social-media-post-reporting-support-scam.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 6 - Social media post reporting support scam</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is a U.S. government agency responsible for administering Social Security, a government program that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to eligible Americans. The SSA issues Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are used to track earnings and benefits for individuals throughout their lives.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On August 7th, the Office of the Inspector General (SSA) issued a scam alert <a href="https://oig.ssa.gov/assets/uploads/scam-alert-hybrid-scams-on-the-rise_08-07-2024.pdf">advisory</a>, warning about scammers escalating their tactics by using fake Amazon or PayPal tech support emails and text messages. These messages aim to connect victims with individuals impersonating Social Security Administration (SSA) employees, who then attempt to convince the targets that their Social Security number (SSN) or record has been compromised.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Scammers use a "long-con" approach and then pass the victim to an imposter pretending to be an SSA agent, exploiting detailed personal information to build trust. This scheme often culminates in the victim handing over valuables or currency during a staged in-person meeting with someone involved in the scam. This method, known as "<a href="https://cyble.com/blog/the-spreading-wave-of-pig-butchering-scams-in-india/">pig butchering</a>," is designed to deplete the victim’s resources.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":57897,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none","align":"center"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img alt="" class="wp-image-57897" src="https://cyble.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-7-–-Advisory-from-SSA.png" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 7 – Advisory from SSA</figcaption></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By leveraging a fake Zoom-themed website and digitally signed binaries, the scammers successfully masked the installation of ScreenConnect software as a legitimate process. The use of ScreenConnect, a widely recognized remote desktop application, further aided in the deception, allowing the scammers to gain unauthorized access to victims' systems under the guise of providing support. This same infrastructure is used for multiple fraudulent activities, including scams targeting Social Security Administration (SSA) account holders. This phishing campaign exemplifies the increasingly sophisticated methods cybercriminals are using to deceive victims into compromising their own systems.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recommendations</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Social Security Administration (SSA) typically contacts beneficiaries through official channels, not unsolicited emails or phone calls. If you receive a suspicious message, do not click on links or provide personal information.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>If you're unsure about the legitimacy of a communication, contact SSA directly through their official website or customer service number, not the contact information provided in the suspicious message.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>SSA will never ask you to download software or applications via email or text. If you receive a request like this, it is likely a scam.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Always verify website URLs to ensure they belong to the legitimate SSA domain (e.g., <a href="http://www.ssa.gov">www.ssa.gov</a>). Scammers may use slight variations in URLs to deceive victims.</li>
