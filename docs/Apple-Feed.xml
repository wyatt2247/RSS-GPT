An investigation by Microsoft has revealed that a North Korean threat actor exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Chromium browser that has been tracked as CVE-2024-7971 to conduct a sophisticated cyber operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to the report, Citrine Sleet, the notorious group behind the attack that targets cryptography sectors in particular, is responsible for the attack.

It has been reported that CVE-2024-7971 is a type of confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that had been impacted in versions of Chrome before 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, threat actors could gain remote code execution (RCE) access to the sandboxed Chromium renderer process and conduct a remote attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There was a vulnerability that was fixed by Google on August 21, 2024, and users should ensure that they are running the most recent version of Chrome.

It is clear from this development that the nation-state adversary is trying to increase its penetration of Windows zero-day exploits in recent months, indicating that they are persistent in their efforts to acquire and introduce oodles of zero-day exploits.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Microsoft security researcher found evidence that Citrine Sleet (formerly DEV-0139 and DEV-1222) was responsible for the activity. Citrine Sleet is also known as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, Nickel Academy, and UNC4736, all of which are associated with Citrine Sleet. There is an assessment that this sub-cluster is part of the Lazarus Group (a.k.a. Diamond Sleet and Hidden Cobra) which is related to Lazarus.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Several analysts have previously credited the use of AppleJeus malware to a Lazarus subgroup called BlueNoroff (also known as APT38, Nickel Gladstone, and Stardust Chollima), indicating the fact that the threat actors share both toolsets and infrastructure from one subgroup to another.

Some cybersecurity vendors maintain track of this North Korean threat group under different names, such as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, and UNC4736, among others.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Hidden Cobra is a term used by the U.S. government to describe malicious actors sponsored by the North Korean government collectively as being influenced by the state. It is mostly targeted at financial institutions, with a special focus on cryptocurrency organizations and individuals who are closely associated with the cryptocurrency industry.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the past, it has been linked to Bureau 121 of the Reconnaissance General Bureau of North Korea, where it practices intelligence gathering.

Moreover, North Korean hackers are also known for using malicious websites that appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to infect prospective victims with fake job applications, weaponized cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading apps designed to steal sensitive information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is the first time UNC4736 malware has been identified in a supply chain attack, for example in March 2023 it attacked the Electron-based desktop client of video conferencing software provider 3CX. Further, they were able to breach the website of Trading Technologies, an automation company for stock market trading, to sneakily push trojanized versions of the X_TRADER software into the system.

In a March 2022 report, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) also linked AppleJeus to the compromise of Trading Technologies' website, highlighting AppleJeus as being behind the attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For years, the U.S. government has repeatedly issued warnings about state-sponsored cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency-related businesses and individuals with AppleJeus malware that is backed by the North Korean government. As a result of the security vulnerability CVE-2024-7971 that was discovered last week, Google patched Chrome's version 8 JavaScript engine and reported it as a type confusion vulnerability.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In a recent cybersecurity incident report, it was revealed that victims were directed to a domain controlled by the threat group Citrine Sleet, identified as voyagorclub[.]space. The exact method by which victims were lured to this domain remains undetermined, though it is suspected that social engineering tactics were employed. This is consistent with Citrine Sleet’s established modus operandi, which frequently involves manipulating individuals through social engineering to initiate attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon successful redirection to the malicious domain, attackers leveraged a zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-7971. This vulnerability is linked to a type of confusion flaw in Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Google addressed this security issue in a recent patch, highlighting that it allowed attackers to achieve RCE within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process of the victim's browser. Once inside this sandboxed environment, the attackers further escalated their access by exploiting a secondary vulnerability in the Windows kernel.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The additional vulnerability, CVE-2024-38106, was exploited to escape the browser’s sandbox environment. This kernel vulnerability, which Microsoft had patched in their latest Patch Tuesday release, allowed attackers to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the compromised system. Following this, the attackers downloaded and activated a highly sophisticated rootkit known as FudModule. This malware, when loaded into memory, enabled direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM), providing attackers with the capability to bypass critical kernel security measures.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The FudModule rootkit is particularly concerning, as it is designed to manipulate kernel-level processes, enabling attackers to establish persistent backdoor access to the compromised system. Through DKOM, the rootkit effectively tampers with core system functions, allowing attackers to evade detection, steal sensitive information, and potentially deploy additional malicious software.

Interestingly, the FudModule rootkit has been linked to another North Korean state-sponsored group known as Diamond Sleet, which has utilized this malware since its discovery in October 2022.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This suggests a potential collaboration between Citrine Sleet and Diamond Sleet or, at the very least, shared access to malicious tools and infrastructure. Furthermore, the rootkit bears similarities to tools used by another notorious hacking group, the Lazarus Group, indicating that FudModule may be part of a broader North Korean cyber-espionage toolkit.

Citrine Sleet's attack demonstrates a highly coordinated and multi-faceted approach, beginning with social engineering techniques to lure victims to a compromised domain and culminating in the exploitation of critical vulnerabilities to gain deep control over target systems.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By leveraging both CVE-2024-7971 and CVE-2024-38106, the attackers were able to bypass multiple layers of security, from browser sandboxing to Windows kernel defences.

Microsoft has issued a series of recommendations to help organizations mitigate the risk of such attacks. They stress the importance of maintaining up-to-date software and operating systems, as timely patching is critical to closing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Microsoft advocates for the deployment of security solutions that provide unified visibility across the entire cyberattack chain. Such tools can detect and block attacker tools and post-compromise malicious activity. Lastly, strengthening the configuration of the operating environment is recommended to minimize the likelihood of successful exploitation and post-compromise activity. 

This incident underscores the evolving nature of cyber threats and highlights the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures to detect, block, and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs).</div>

This might be the case because a lot of individuals found out about the news only after reading the stories they had missed over the weekend, or because third-party sources of app store intelligence take a little longer to report changes in rankings.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to Appfigures, an app intelligence company, Telegram didn't rise to the No. 2 spot on the Social Networking charts on the U.S. App Store until 3 a.m. EST on Monday, suggesting that the app is just now starting to gain traction. The app had already fallen to No. 3 in Social in the U.S. as of the time of publication, so it might only be a temporary boost.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, the app shot to the top of the App Store's Social Networking category and rose to become the third most popular app overall in France, the country where Durov was arrested. After climbing ten spots since Friday, Telegram now stands at No. 8 in the top apps chart (which does not include games). Appfigures stated that this is the highest position it has held here since at least January 1, 2023. Apple often uses a combination of measures, including download velocity and app install count, to determine app store rankings.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Nevertheless, the cliché "any press is good press" appears to hold true, at least in terms of Telegram's exposure on the App Store. As consumers downloaded the app out of curiosity — or possibly to support the founder's views about "free speech" — it began to rise in the rankings.</span></div></span>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Citrine Sleet threat actor group was observed by Microsoft researchers exploiting the CVE-2024-7971 zero-day vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which affects versions of Chromium prior to 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attackers achieved remote code execution (RCE) within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process. Google has since released a patch for the vulnerability, on August 21, 2024, and users are advised to update to the latest version of Chromium to mitigate the risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;Technical Analysis&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The observed attack chain involved a typical browser exploit sequence, starting with targets being directed to a Citrine Sleet-controlled exploit domain, voyagorclub[.]space, through common social engineering tactics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the users were connected, the zero-day RCE exploit for CVE-2024-7971 was deployed, allowing the attackers to download and load shellcode containing a Windows sandbox escape exploit and the FudModule rootkit into memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>FudModule is an advanced rootkit <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">malware</a> designed to target kernel access while avoiding detection. Threat actors have been seen using the FudModule data-only rootkit to gain admin-to-kernel access on Windows-based systems, enabling read/write primitive operations and conducting Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attack chain seen in Citrine Sleet's zero-day exploit of CVE-2024-7971 closely mirrors the chain observed by Avast, which involves a variant of FudModule known as "FudModule 2.0." This variant includes malicious loaders and a late-stage remote access trojan (RAT). The research identified the previously unknown Kaolin RAT as the malware responsible for deploying the FudModule rootkit on targeted devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion and Recommendations&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>CVE-2024-7971 is the third vulnerability this year that North Korean threat actors have exploited to deploy the FudModule rootkit, following CVE-2024-21338 and CVE-2024-38193. To address zero-day exploits effectively, it is crucial not only to keep systems updated but also to use security solutions that offer comprehensive visibility across the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cyberattack</a> chain to detect and block attacker tools and malicious activities after exploitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To mitigate the risks posed by Citrine Sleet and similar threats, the following best practices are recommended:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Activate the automatic software update function on your computer, mobile device, and any other linked devices when feasible and practical. </li>

By using phishing tactics, hackers are targeting users' passwords for Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon through phishing campaigns that pose significant risks to their personal information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A new notice has appeared warning users of Google Mail, Facebook, and Amazon that there has been a new attack on password hacking that puts their personal information at risk because society has gone digital and protecting your credentials is "the name of the game." 

There is no denying the fact that these platforms are among the most popular in the world, so it is vital to have a good understanding of what threats are coming and what possibilities there are to prevent these threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Overall, cybersecurity experts predict a steady increase for the year, but they also note that the complexity of password hacks for Gmail and Facebook, as well as attempts to access Amazon accounts, has grown dramatically as well. It has been found that the complexity of password hacks for Gmail and Facebook has increased dramatically as a result of increased complexity in the attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Typically, these hacking attempts benefit from phishing attacks, brute force attacks, and social engineering attacks, all of which are designed to take advantage of overly trustful users or weaknesses within the platforms that make them vulnerable.

Several new threat analyses, including those conducted by Kaspersky Labs, reveal that password theft attacks have become increasingly common against Amazon users, Facebook users, and, most of all, Google users. 

There have been several attacks targeting these platforms, including those aimed at stealing passwords.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Kaspersky reported an increase of 40% in attempts of hackers to entice users to access malicious sites impersonating these brands in comparison to last year based on a study it conducted.

It is no surprise that malicious hackers are seeking credentials for Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon accounts to spread their malicious programming. As a matter of fact, these accounts may be exploited to reach the full heights of cybercrime by committing data theft, malware distribution, and credit card fraud all at the same time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Google account is a skeleton key that can be used to unlock an entire treasure trove of other account credentials, as well as personal information, enabling fraudsters to access a treasure trove of private information. The information contained in a user's Gmail inbox is immeasurable when compared to that contained in their inbox on the web, and the chances are that they will have one given how popular this web-based free email service is with most people these days. 

As per Kaspersky reports, hackers are mainly targeting Google, Amazon, and Facebook passwords in their effort to steal personal information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the first half of 2024, Kaspersky Security reported a 243% increase in the number of attack attempts, with the company itself preventing approximately 4 million attempts. It is estimated that Facebook users were exposed to 3.7 million phishing attempts during the same period, and Amazon users were exposed to 3 million.&nbsp;

In an interview with Kaspersky Internet Security, Olga Svistunova, who is an expert in data security at the company, warned that a criminal with access to a Gmail account may be able to access "multiple services".&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, it is important to note that not only may business information be leaked as a result, but also the personal information of customers can also be leaked as a result.

To target these platforms, hackers are looking for account passwords, as getting access to these platforms allows them to commit fraud, distribute malware, and steal sensitive information. It is proposed that Google accounts are especially valuable since they can be used to hack into other accounts and to collect personal information that can be used in fraud attempts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to researchers at GuidePoint Research and Intelligence Team, Rui Ataide and Hermes Bojaxhi of the GuidePoint Research and Intelligence Team, there is an ongoing phishing campaign targeting more than 130 U.S. organizations, which has been detected as a new and worrying one. There have been so many misuses of the term "highly sophisticated threat actor" in recent years that it almost has lost all meaning, but the tactics and intrusion capabilities that were employed by this as-yet-unnamed attacker have led the GRIT researchers to conclude that this attacker deserves to be called such a label.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A spear-phishing attack, as with other spear-phishing campaigns, revolves around the targeting of specific employees within an organization rather than attempting to hit every single email account in an organization with a scattergun approach, as is so often the case with so-called spear-phishing campaigns.

The attack has also targeted other tech giants, including Microsoft and Apple, as well as numerous smaller companies. Additionally, DHL, Mastercard, Netflix, eBay, and HSBC are also among the companies involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cloud security provider Netskope, in a recent report, found a 2,000-fold increase in traffic to phishing pages sent through Microsoft Sway, a cloud-based application that provides users with the ability to create visual instructions, newsletters, and presentations through the use of visual illustrations.

Hackers are increasingly exploiting a technique known as “quishing,” a form of phishing that utilizes QR codes to deceive users into logging into malicious websites, thereby stealing their passwords. This method is particularly effective as QR codes can bypass email scanners designed to detect text-based threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, since QR codes are frequently scanned with mobile devices—which often lack the robust security measures found on desktops and laptops—users become more vulnerable to these types of attacks.

A new variant of QR code phishing has been recently detailed by J. Stephen Kowski, the Field Chief Technology Officer at SlashNext, in a LinkedIn article. Unlike traditional QR code phishing, which typically involves an image-based QR code redirecting users to a malicious site, this new method leverages Unicode text characters to create QR codes.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Kowski, this approach presents three significant challenges for defenders: it evades image-based analysis, ensures accurate screen rendering, and creates a duality in appearance between the screen rendering and plain text, making detection more difficult.

Given these emerging threats, individuals who frequently use platforms such as Google’s Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon, as well as other major online services, should exercise caution to avoid becoming victims of identity theft. The risk of falling prey to password-hacking attempts can be significantly reduced by adhering to best practices in security hygiene across different accounts and maintaining a high level of vigilance.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In today’s technology-driven world, personal awareness and proactive measures serve as the first line of defence against such cyber threats.



Protecting Business Accounts from Phishing Attacks&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Recognize Phishing Indicators</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">- Generic Domain Extensions: Be cautious of emails from generic domains like "@gmail.com" instead of corporate domains, as attackers use these to impersonate businesses.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Misspelt Domains: </b>Watch for near-identical domains that slightly alter legitimate ones, such as "Faceb0ok.com." These deceptive domains are used to trick users into providing sensitive information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Content Quality:</b> Legitimate communications are typically polished and professional. Spelling errors, poor grammar, and unprofessional formatting are red flags of phishing attempts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Urgency and Fear Tactics:</b> Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency, pressuring recipients to act quickly to avoid negative consequences, such as account suspensions or security breaches.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Unusual Requests:</b> Be wary of unexpected requests for money, personal information, or prompts to click links or download attachments. Hackers often impersonate trusted entities to deceive recipients.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Implement Security Software&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">-<b> Install robust security tools,</b> including firewalls, spam filters, and antivirus software, to guard against phishing attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">- <b>Utilize web filters</b> to restrict access to malicious websites.

   - Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities and protect against new threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Enhance account security</b> by implementing MFA, which requires a second verification factor (e.g., a code, fingerprint, or secret question) in addition to a password.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- MFA significantly</b> reduces the risk of unauthorized access and helps safeguard business credentials.

By staying vigilant, maintaining updated security software, and utilizing MFA, businesses can better protect their accounts and sensitive information from phishing attacks.</div>

This campaign has sparked a heated debate between two tech giants, Apple and Google, over the best way to protect user privacy online.<p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Apple’s Stance on Privacy</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has long positioned itself as a champion of user <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/google-assures-privacy-with-gemini-ai.html" target="_blank">privacy</a>. In its latest campaign, Apple highlights the extensive use of tracking cookies by Google Chrome. These cookies, Apple claims, follow users across the web, collecting data on their browsing habits. Apple argues that Chrome’s Incognito mode, which many users rely on for private browsing, isn’t truly private. According to Apple, Incognito mode still allows websites to track user activity, albeit to a lesser extent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To counter these privacy concerns, Apple promotes its own browser, Safari, as a more secure alternative. Safari, Apple claims, uses Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) to limit the ability of advertisers to track users across websites. This feature, combined with other privacy-focused tools, makes Safari a more attractive option for users who prioritize their online privacy.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Google’s Response</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/google-assures-privacy-with-gemini-ai.html" target="_blank">Google</a>, on the other hand, has defended Chrome’s privacy practices. In response to Apple’s campaign, Google emphasized that Chrome is designed to keep user data safe and give users control over their privacy settings. Google points out that Chrome offers a range of privacy features, including the ability to block third-party cookies and manage site permissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google also highlights its commitment to transparency. The company regularly updates its privacy policies and provides users with clear information about how their data is collected and used. Google argues that this transparency, combined with robust privacy controls, makes Chrome a trustworthy choice for users.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Broader Context</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">This clash between Apple and Google is part of a larger conversation about online privacy. As more of our lives move online, the amount of data we generate has skyrocketed. This data is incredibly valuable to advertisers, who use it to target ads more effectively. However, this data collection has raised significant privacy concerns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many users are unaware of the extent to which their online activities are tracked. Even when using private browsing modes, such as Chrome’s Incognito mode, users may still be tracked by websites and advertisers. This has led to calls for greater transparency and stronger privacy protections.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the Right Browser</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">So, what does this mean for the average user? When choosing a browser, it’s important to consider your privacy needs. If you prioritize privacy and want to limit tracking as much as possible, Safari may be the better choice. Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention and other privacy features can help protect your data from advertisers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, if you value customization and control over your browsing experience, Chrome offers a range of privacy tools that can be tailored to your needs. Google’s transparency about its data collection practices also provides users with a clear understanding of how their data is used.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, the choice between Safari and Chrome comes down to personal preference. Both browsers have their strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will depend on your individual privacy needs and browsing habits.</p>

It underscores how threat actors are increasingly targeting the OS as a target.

As of late 2023, malware dubbed Cthulhu Stealer was available as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) product and was priced at $500 per month as part of a subscription-based price structure.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As far as the architecture is concerned, it can support both x86_64 and Arm platforms. 

Several cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new form of macOS malware that can steal user's sensitive data in the most insidious ways. A malware called Cthulhu Stealer has been spotted that impersonates popular applications to infect users with Trojan malware that allows the malware to steal passwords for users' operating systems and the iCloud keychain, as well as cryptocurrency wallets.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A $500/month service offering for bad actors has reportedly been available since late 2023, as part of the Cthulhu Stealer program. It is particularly effective because it can masquerade as legitimate software and thus make itself appear more appealing.

A Cado Security researcher has pointed out that Cthulhu Stealer is an Apple disk image (DMG) that carries two binaries, depending on the architecture of the machine, according to Gould.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Using Golang, the malware disguises itself as a legitimate piece of software and disguises itself as a malicious application.

A few of the software programs it impersonates include CleanMyMac, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Adobe GenP because the last of these is an open-source tool that can patch Adobe apps to bypass Creative Cloud service encryption and use the serial key to activate them without having to create a login account with a creator's account.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A user who launches an unsigned file that has been explicitly allowed to be run – i.e., bypassing Gatekeeper protections – will be prompted to enter their system password when they launch it. In addition to Atomic Stealer, Cuckoo, MacStealer, and Banshee Stealer using this postscript-based approach, other software developers have adopted similar approaches.

Afterwards, a second prompt will appear asking the user to enter their MetaMask password for the third time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This tool was also designed with the goal of harvesting system information and dumping iCloud Keychain passwords using an open-source tool called Chain Breaker which an anonymous developer developed.

There are several ways the data theft takes place, including through the use of web browser cookies and information from Telegram accounts. This information is compressed and stored in a ZIP file, before being sent to a command-and-control server (C2).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is believed that the main purpose of Cthulhu Stealer is to steal credentials and cryptocurrency wallets from a wide range of shops and services, including game accounts, to steal information.

The functionality and features of Cthulhu Stealer are very similar to that of Atomic Stealer, which implies that it was probably developed by the same person who modified Atomic Stealer. As users can see from the above paragraph, Atomic Stealer and Cthulhu both use Osascript as a password prompt. Even the spelling mistakes in the two games are identical.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result, the threat actors responsible for the malware appear to have vanished, in part due to disagreements over payments, which has led to affiliates accusing the main developer of an exit scam, which has led to him being permanently banned from the cybercrime marketplace he used to advertise the malware in the first place.

It is important to note that Cthulhu Stealer does not have very sophisticated anti-analysis techniques that would allow it to operate stealthily, which could be used to avoid detection.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As well as this, it does not include any features that set it apart from similar underground offerings, apart from the fortress is one issue that affects this.

Malware like Cthulhu Stealer, as well as other software threats like it, can cause far less damage when users take macOS' security features seriously, so they do not fall victim to them.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">MacOS is much less commonly targeted by malware threats than Windows or Linux, but users are advised to stay away from downloading software from sources they don't trust, stay away from installing apps that are not verified, and make sure their systems are updated with the latest security measures.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There has been a surge in macOS malware recently and in response Apple announced this week that an update is coming to its next version of the operating system that will add more friction when trying to open software that is not signed correctly or notarized, which will help prevent future outbreaks of macOS malware.</div>

One such tool is the CAPTCHA solver developed by Greasy Opal, a name that has become synonymous with cybercrime over the past 16 years. This blog delves into the history, impact, and ongoing relevance of Greasy Opal’s CAPTCHA solver in the cybercriminal ecosystem.<p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Genesis of Greasy Opal’s CAPTCHA Solver</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">CAPTCHAs, or Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart, were introduced as a security measure to prevent automated bots from accessing websites and online services. However, as with any security measure, some sought to circumvent it. Enter Greasy Opal, a developer who saw an opportunity in the burgeoning field of CAPTCHA-solving technology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Greasy Opal’s tool, which started as a simple script, quickly evolved into a sophisticated piece of software capable of solving CAPTCHAs with high accuracy. The tool’s effectiveness made it a favorite among cybercriminals, who used it to automate various illicit activities, from spamming and social media promotion to black hat SEO and account takeovers.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Mechanics of CAPTCHA Solving</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">At its core, a CAPTCHA solver mimics human behavior to bypass the security checks designed to differentiate between humans and bots. Greasy Opal’s solver employs advanced machine learning algorithms and image recognition techniques to decode the distorted text and images commonly used in CAPTCHAs. The tool’s ability to solve CAPTCHAs at scale has made it an invaluable asset for cybercriminals looking to automate their operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The solver is available in free and paid versions, offering higher accuracy and faster recognition times. This tiered approach has allowed Greasy Opal to monetize the tool while maintaining a veneer of legitimacy by paying taxes and operating as a seemingly lawful business.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Impact on Cybercrime</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The widespread use of Greasy Opal’s CAPTCHA solver has had a profound impact on the cybercriminal landscape. By automating the process of solving CAPTCHAs, the tool has lowered the barrier to entry for less-skilled threat actors, enabling them to carry out large-scale attacks with minimal effort. This democratization of cybercrime has led to an increase in the volume and sophistication of attacks targeting various sectors, including e-commerce, social media, and government services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Prominent entities such as Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have been targeted using Greasy Opal’s tool, highlighting the far-reaching implications of this technology. Researchers at Arkose Labs have acknowledged the tool’s efficiency, noting its role in facilitating a wide range of cybercriminal activities.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ethical and Legal Considerations</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite its clear association with illegal activities, Greasy Opal continues to operate under a legitimate guise. The developer’s decision to pay taxes and comply with certain legal requirements has allowed them to avoid significant legal repercussions. However, this raises important ethical questions about the responsibility of developers in the cybersecurity space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The case of Greasy Opal underscores the need for stricter regulations and enforcement mechanisms to curb the misuse of technology for criminal purposes. It also highlights the importance of ongoing research and innovation in developing more robust security measures to counteract such threats.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Future of CAPTCHA Solving</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">As cybersecurity measures continue to evolve, so too will the techniques used to bypass them. Greasy Opal’s CAPTCHA solver is a testament to the enduring cat-and-mouse game between security professionals and cybercriminals. While CAPTCHAs remain a widely used security measure, their effectiveness is increasingly being called into question as tools like Greasy Opal’s become more advanced.</p>

<p>
<em><b>Update (07/22/2024): </b>Website operators who will be impacted by the upcoming change in Chrome for new TLS certificates issued after October 31, 2024 can explore continuity options offered by Entrust. Entrust has expressed its commitment to continuing to support customer needs, and is best positioned to describe the available options for website operators. Learn more at Entrust’s <a href="https://www.entrust.com/tls-certificate-information-center">TLS Certificate Information Center</a>.</em>
</p>

    

<p>
The Chrome Security Team prioritizes the security and privacy of Chrome’s users, and we are unwilling to compromise on these values.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/">Chrome Root Program Policy</a> states that CA certificates included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a> must provide value to Chrome end users that exceeds the risk of their continued inclusion. It also describes many of the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/#7-reporting-and-responding-to-incidents">factors</a> we consider significant when CA Owners disclose and respond to incidents. When things don’t go right, we expect CA Owners to commit to meaningful and demonstrable change resulting in evidenced continuous improvement.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past several years, publicly disclosed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?o2=greaterthaneq&amp;short_desc_type=casesubstring&amp;o1=notequals&amp;v1=Graveyard&amp;classification=Client%20Software&amp;classification=Developer%20Infrastructure&amp;classification=Components&amp;classification=Server%20Software&amp;classification=Other&amp;classification=Graveyard&amp;v2=2015-11-01&amp;f1=classification&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED&amp;short_desc=Entrust&amp;f2=creation_ts&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;list_id=17064895">incident reports</a> highlighted a pattern of concerning behaviors by Entrust that fall short of the above expectations, and has eroded confidence in their competence, reliability, and integrity as a publicly-trusted CA Owner. 
</p>
<p>
In response to the above concerns and to preserve the integrity of the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/how-chrome-root-program-keeps-users-safe.html#:~:text=Chrome%20uses%20digital,the%20%E2%80%9CWeb%20PKI.%E2%80%9D">Web PKI</a> ecosystem, Chrome will take the following actions.

<p>
Additionally, should a Chrome user or enterprise <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#Does-the-Chrome-Certificate-Verifier-consider-local-trust-decisions">explicitly trust</a> any of the above certificates on a platform and version of Chrome <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#when-did-these-features-land">relying</a> on the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a> (e.g., explicit trust is conveyed through a Group Policy Object on Windows), the SCT-based constraints described above will be overridden and certificates will function as they do today.  
</p>
<p>
To further minimize risk of disruption, website operators are encouraged to review the “Frequently Asked Questions" listed below.
</p>
<h3><strong>Why is Chrome taking action?</strong></h3>


<p>
Certification Authorities (CAs) serve a privileged and trusted role on the Internet that underpin encrypted connections between browsers and websites. With this tremendous responsibility comes an expectation of adhering to reasonable and consensus-driven security and compliance expectations, including those defined by the CA/Browser TLS Baseline Requirements.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past six years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports. When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the Internet ecosystem, it is our opinion that Chrome’s continued trust in Entrust is no longer justified. 
</p>
<h3><strong>When will this action happen?</strong></h3>


<p>
Blocking action will begin on approximately November 1, 2024, affecting certificates issued at that point or later.
</p>
<p>
Blocking action will occur in Versions of <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule">Chrome 127</a> and greater on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Android, and Linux. Apple policies prevent the Chrome Certificate Verifier and corresponding Chrome Root Store from being used on Chrome for iOS.
</p>
<h3><strong>What is the user impact of this action?</strong></h3>


<p>
By default, Chrome users in the above populations who navigate to a website serving a certificate issued by Entrust or AffirmTrust after October 31, 2024 will see a full page interstitial <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/">similar to this one</a>.
</p>
<p>
Certificates issued by other CAs are not impacted by this action.
</p>
<h3><strong>How can a website operator tell if their website is affected?</strong></h3>


<p>
Website operators can determine if they are affected by this issue by using the Chrome Certificate Viewer.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use the Chrome Certificate Viewer</span>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Navigate to a website (e.g., <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>)

</li><li>Click the “Tune" icon

</li><li>Click “Connection is Secure" 

</li><li>Click “Certificate is Valid" (the Chrome Certificate Viewer will open) 
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Website owner action is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span> contain “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
 
</li><li><strong>Website owner action is required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading contains “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
</ul>
<h3><strong>What does an affected website operator do?</strong></h3>


<p>
We recommend that affected website operators transition to a new publicly-trusted CA Owner as soon as reasonably possible. To avoid adverse website user impact, action <strong>must</strong> be completed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the existing certificate(s) expire if expiry is planned to take place <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> October 31, 2024. 
</p>
<p>
While website operators could delay the impact of blocking action by choosing to collect and install a new TLS certificate issued from Entrust before Chrome’s blocking action begins on November 1, 2024, website operators will inevitably need to collect and install a new TLS certificate from one of the many other CAs included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a>.
</p>
<h3><strong>Can I test these changes before they take effect?</strong></h3>


<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p>
A command-line flag was added beginning in Chrome 128 (available in Canary/Dev at the time of this post’s publication) that allows administrators and power users to simulate the effect of an SCTNotAfter distrust constraint as described in this blog post FAQ.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to: Simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust</span></p><p>1. Close all open versions of Chrome</p><p>2. Start Chrome using the following command-line flag, substituting variables described below with actual values</p>

<div class="code">
--test-crs-constraints=$[Comma Separated List of Trust Anchor Certificate SHA256 Hashes]:sctnotafter=$[epoch_timestamp]
</div><p>

</p><p>3. Evaluate the effects of the flag with test websites&nbsp;</p><p><b>Example:</b>&nbsp;The following command will simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust with an effective date of April 30, 2024 11:59:59 PM GMT for all of the Entrust trust anchors included in the Chrome Root Store. The expected behavior is that any website whose certificate is issued before the enforcement date/timestamp will function in Chrome, and all issued after will display an interstitial.</p><p>

</p><h3><strong>I use Entrust certificates for my internal enterprise network, do I need to do anything?</strong></h3><p>
Beginning in Chrome 127, enterprises can override Chrome Root Store constraints like those described for Entrust in this blog post by installing the corresponding root CA certificate as a <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#Does-the-Chrome-Certificate-Verifier-consider-local-trust-decisions">locally-trusted root</a> on the platform Chrome is running (e.g., installed in the Microsoft Certificate Store as a Trusted Root CA).
</p><h3><strong>How do enterprises add a CA as locally-trusted?</strong></h3><p>
Customer organizations should defer to platform provider guidance.

<p>
Google and Apple have worked together to create an industry specification – <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/">Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers</a> – for Bluetooth tracking devices that makes it possible to alert users across both Android and iOS if such a device is unknowingly being used to track them. This will help mitigate the misuse of devices designed to help keep track of belongings. Google is now launching this capability on Android 6.0+ devices, and today Apple is implementing this capability in iOS 17.5.<br />
</p>
<p>
With this new capability, Android users will now get a “Tracker traveling with you” alert on their device if an unknown Bluetooth tracking device is seen moving with them over time, regardless of the platform the device is paired with. 
</p>
<p>
If a user gets such an alert on their Android device, it means that someone else’s AirTag, Find My Device network-compatible tracker tag, or other industry specification-compatible Bluetooth tracker is moving with them. Android users can view the tracker’s identifier, have the tracker play a sound to help locate it, and access instructions to disable it. Bluetooth tag manufacturers including Chipolo, eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee have committed that future tags will be compatible.
</p>
<p>
Google’s Find My Device is secure by default and private by design. <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-network-security-privacy-protections.html">Multi-layered user protections</a>, including first of its kind safety-first protections, help mitigate potential risks to user privacy and safety while allowing users to effectively locate and recover lost devices. This cross-platform collaboration — an industry first, involving community and industry input — offers instructions and best practices for manufacturers, should they choose to build unwanted tracking alert capabilities into their products. Google and Apple will continue to work with the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> via the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers working group to develop the official standard for this technology.

<title>Announcing Pwn2Own Ireland – Bringing Pwn2Own (and WhatsApp) to the Emerald Isle</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/7/16/announcing-pwn2own-ireland-2024</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/7/16/announcing-pwn2own-ireland-2024</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class=""><em>If you just want to read the rules, you can find them </em><a href="https://zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnIreland2024Rules.html" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Over the last few years, our consumer-focused Pwn2Own event took place in the Trend Micro office in Toronto. However, that office closed, so we needed to find a new home. This isn’t unusual for this event, as it moved from Amsterdam to Tokyo to Austin to Toronto. We’re moving again. This year, we are heading to our offices in Cork, Ireland! We’re excited about our new location, and I personally have <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/IimtaPyt7uE?feature=share" target="_blank">viewed</a> several locations for after-hours and special events. Some of those will be secret until the competition, but I can tell you that our awards ceremony and end-of-contest party will be held at the historic <a href="https://corkcitygaol.com/" target="_blank">Cork City Goal</a>. It promises to be a fun and spooky event, and we’ll have more details about that in the future.</p><p class="">Beyond our new location, we’re excited to announce <strong>Meta</strong> has joined as a sponsor of this event and will participate in the new Messenger App category. That’s right – <strong>WhatsApp</strong> will be a target, with both 0-click and 1-click exploits being in scope. We’re offering $300,000 USD for a 0-click, so we hope to see some great research on an application used by millions. We’re also excited to announce the return of <strong>Synology</strong> as a co-sponsor of the event and <strong>QNAP</strong> joins them as a co-sponsor. </p><p class="">The Messenger App category isn’t the only exciting thing heading to Ireland. This will be our first competition to feature AI-enabled devices. Both the Samsung and Google phones include <a href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/smartphones/galaxy-s24/?cid=ca_pd_ppc_google_f1h24-galaxy-s24-series_launch_im-hhp-retention_text_rtb_20180102-w-samsung%20galaxy%20s24&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7sPGn7WshwMViG8PAh1PfQdiEAAYASAAEgJoF_D_BwE#:~:text=Buy%20now-,Galaxy%20AI%20is%20here,-Welcome%20to%20the">Galaxy AI</a> and <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/categories/ai/">Google AI</a> respectively. Multiple Synology devices use AI for tasks such as people and vehicle recognition on the cameras and AI-driven photo albums on their NAS devices. The Ubiquiti camera also uses AI for greater detection precision and range. There’s no special bonus for exploiting an AI feature, but it will be interesting to see if AI helps or hurts exploit attempts.</p><p class="">Last year’s favorite category was the “SOHO Smashup”, and it returns for another year. This category challenges contestants by having them start by exploiting the external interface of a router, compromise the router, and then pivot to another device connected to the network. In the Toronto event last year, several teams had winning entries in this category. It’s always amazing to watch the researchers as they pivot through multiple attack surfaces to hit their final goal. We’re also bringing wired and wireless cameras back into the contest under the surveillance category. Last year, we awarded $1,038,500 during the event for 58 unique 0-days. It will be interesting to see if the luck of the Irish will take that number up or down.</p><p class="">As for the contest itself, it will run from October 22-25, 2024. As always, we’ll have a random drawing to determine the schedule of attempts on the first day of the contest, and we will proceed from there. Registration closes at 5:00 p.m. Irish Standard Time on Oct 17th, 2024. There are no exceptions for late entries, so if you have questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:pwn2own@trendmicro.com">pwn2own@trendmicro.com</a> (note the new address). We will be happy to address your issues or concerns directly.</p><p class="">Now on to the specific target categories. We’ll have seven different categories for this year’s event:</p>





















  
  



<p><a name="top"></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#phones">- Mobile Phones</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#whatsapp">- Messenger Apps</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#soho">- The SOHO Smashup</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#cams">- Surveilance Systems</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#hubs">- Home Automation Hubs</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#printer">- Printers</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#speaker">- Smart Speakers</a><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#nas">- NAS Devices</a>  </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at each category in more detail, starting with mobile phones.</p>
<p><a name="phones"></a></p>
<p><b>The Target Phones</b></p>




  <p class="">Back in Amsterdam where this contest originated, it was originally dubbed “Mobile Pwn2Own” and our focus was strictly on phones. Mobile handsets remain at the heart of this event, and some of the Samsung entries from last year were absolutely smashing. As always, these phones will be running the latest version of their respective operating systems with all available updates installed. You may notice there are no Xiaomi devices in this year’s event. That’s because, during the contest last year, they took measures to ensure attempts would fail. They didn’t seem to mind that those measures impacted all of their users globally. While we do encourage shenanigans, that’s a bit too far to be considered fair. Thus, they are not returning. If you want more details about what happened, be sure to check out Ken Gannon and Ilyes Beghdadi’s upcoming <a href="https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-speakers.html#54454" target="_blank">DEFCON talk</a> about the subject.</p><p class="">In this category, contestants must compromise the device by browsing to content in the default browser for the target under test or by communicating with the following short-distance protocols: near field communication (NFC), Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. The awards for this category are:</p>

  <p class="">The Google and Apple devices in this category also include an add-on bonus. If your exploit payload executes with kernel-level privileges, you earn an additional <strong>$50,000</strong> and 5 more Master of Pwn points. That means a full exploit chain that includes kernel-level access on the iPhone or Pixel will earn <strong>$300,000 </strong>and 30 Master of Pwn points.</p>





















  
  



<p><a name="whatsapp"></a>
<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a></p>
<p><b>Messenger Apps</b></p>




  <p class="">Almost everyone uses some messenger app in their daily lives, and these apps have been the target of sophisticated threats in the past. We’re excited that Meta has agreed to sponsor this event and are hopeful that one (or more) of our contestants will demonstrate a WhatsApp exploit. Both 0-click and 1-click exploits are in scope. All valid submissions must use vulnerabilities reachable via WhatsApp and must not depend on other applications. All WhatsApp entries will be run on a Google Pixel 8.</p>

<p><a name="soho"></a>
<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a></p>
<p><b>The SOHO Smashup</b></p>




  <p class="">The proliferation of WFH resulted in many enterprises finding their network perimeter relocated to the home office. Threat actors exploiting home routers and consumer devices can use these as a launch point for lateral movements into enterprise resources. We wanted to demonstrate this during the contest, which means the SOHO Smashup category continues to be relevant. Contestants will need to first compromise the WAN port on a selected router. Once they accomplish that not-so-insignificant feat, they will need to pivot to one of the other devices and compromise it as well. The contestant is free to select any combination of router and home automation hub, smart speaker, printer, or network-attached storage device during the registration process – although you won’t have some of the same easy targets as last year. If they get both devices within 30 minutes, they earn $100,000 and 10 Master of Pwn points. </p>

<p><b>Surveillance Systems</b></p>




  <p class="">Last year, we introduced this category not knowing what to expect. As usual, our contestants did not disappoint as they unleashed some fantastic exploits – including taking over a camera just by showing it a QR code. Cameras continue to be a part of daily life, and we can’t wait to see what research is put on display this year. An attempt in this category must be launched against the target’s exposed network services or the target’s exposed features from the contestant’s laptop within the contest network.</p>

<p><b>Home Automation Hubs</b></p>




  <p class="">Many of the cameras and other “smart” devices are connected to a centralized hub. From lights to locks to thermostats, cameras, and more, all can be accessed through a home automation hub. Of course, that means a threat actor could potentially access them as well. This year, we’re introducing the AeoTec Smart Home Hub in this category, so we’ll see if our contestants take a run at it. Here are the targets in the Home Automation category:</p>

<p><b>Rage Against the Printers </b></p>




  <p class="">Printers have long been the source of jokes and memes, but they are also an often overlooked attack surface in your office. The printer category always produces some interesting results, often by playing music it shouldn’t or the occasional Rick Roll. It will be interesting to see what exploits the contestants come up with this year.</p>

  <p class=""><strong>Master of Pwn</strong></p><p class="">No Pwn2Own contest would be complete without crowning a Master of Pwn, which signifies the overall winner of the competition. Earning the title results in a slick <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eyexso3WUAYbXPK?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096">trophy</a>, a different sort of <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1240400682034909187">wearable</a>, and brings with it an additional 65,000 ZDI reward points (instant <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/about/benefits/">Platinum</a> status in 2025).</p><p class="">For those not familiar with how it works, points are accumulated for each successful attempt. While only the first demonstration in a category wins the full cash award, each successful entry claims the full number of Master of Pwn points. Since the order of attempts is determined by a random draw, those who receive later slots can still claim the Master of Pwn title – even if they earn a lower cash payout. As with previous contests, there are penalties for withdrawing from an attempt once you register for it. If the contestant decides to remove an Add-on Bonus during their attempt, the Master of Pwn points for that Add-on Bonus will be deducted from the final point total for that attempt. For example, someone registers for the Apple iPhone 15 with the Kernel Bonus Add-on. During the attempt, the contestant drops the Kernel Bonus Add-on but completes the attempt. The final point total will be 20 Master of Pwn points.</p><p class=""><strong>The Complete Details</strong></p><p class="">The full set of rules for Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 can be found <a href="https://zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnIreland2024Rules.html" target="_blank">here</a>. They may be changed at any time without notice. We highly encourage potential entrants to read the rules <em>thoroughly</em> and <em>completely</em> should they choose to participate. We also encourage contestants to read <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/5/3/what-to-expect-when-exploiting-a-guide-to-pwn2own-participation">this blog</a> covering what to expect when participating in Pwn2Own.</p><p class="">Registration is required to ensure we have sufficient resources on hand at the event. Please contact ZDI at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:pwn2own@trendmicro.com?subject=Pwn2Own%20Tokyo%202023%20Registration">pwn2own@trendmicro.com</a>&nbsp;to begin the registration process. (Email only, please; queries via social media, blog post, or other means will not be acknowledged or answered.) If we receive more than one registration for any category, we’ll hold a random drawing to determine the contest order. Registration closes at 5:00 p.m. Irish Standard Time on Oct 17th, 2024.</p><p class=""><strong>The Results</strong></p><p class="">We’ll be <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog" target="_blank">blogging</a>&nbsp;and tweeting results in real time throughout the competition.

<title>The May 2024 Security Update Review</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/5/14/the-may-2024-security-update-review</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/5/14/the-may-2024-security-update-review</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="">Welcome to the second Tuesday of May. As expected, Adobe and Microsoft have released their standard bunch of security patches. Take a break from your regular activities and join us as we review the details of their latest advisories. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>





















  
  






  <p class=""><strong>Apple Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">Apple kicked off the May release cycle with a group of updates for their macOS and iOS platforms. Most notable is a fix for CVE-2024-23296 for <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214100" target="_blank">iOS 16.7.8 and iPadOS 16.7.8</a>. This vulnerability is a memory corruption issue in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMawXNtXrQ">RTKit</a> that could allow attackers to bypass kernel memory protections. The initial patch was released back in March, but Apple noted additional fixes would be coming, and here they are. This bug is reported as being under active attack, so if you’re using a device with an affected OS, make sure you get the update.</p><p class="">Apple also patched the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214103" target="_blank">Safari</a> bug demonstrated at Pwn2Own Vancouver by Master of Pwn Winner Manfred Paul.</p><p class=""><strong>Adobe Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">For May, Adobe released eight patches addressing 37 CVEs in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, Illustrator, Substance3D Painter, Adobe Aero, Substance3D Designer, Adobe Animate, FrameMaker, and Dreamweaver. Eight of these vulnerabilities were reported through the ZDI program. The update for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb24-29.html" target="_blank">Reader</a> should be the priority. It includes multiple Critical-rated bugs that are often used by malware and ransomware gangs. While none of these bugs are under active attack, it is likely some will eventually be exploited. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb24-30.html">Illustrator</a> also addresses a couple of Critical-rated bugs that could result in arbitrary code execution. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/aero/apsb24-33.html" target="_blank">Aero</a> (an augmented reality authoring and publishing tool) fixes a single code execution bug. Unless I’m mistaken, this is the first Adobe patch for this product.</p><p class="">The fix for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/animate/apsb24-36.html" target="_blank">Adobe Animate</a> fixes eight bugs, seven of which result in Critical-rated code execution. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/framemaker/apsb24-37.html">FrameMaker</a> also fixes several code execution bugs. These are classic open-and-own bugs that require user interaction. That’s the same for the single bug fixed in <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/dreamweaver/apsb24-39.html">Dreamweaver</a>. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/substance3d_painter/apsb24-31.html">Substance 3D Painter</a> addresses four bugs, two of which are rated Critical, while the patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/substance3d_designer/apsb24-35.html">Substance 3D Designer</a> fixes a single Important-rated memory leak.</p><p class="">None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3.</p><p class=""><strong>Microsoft Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">This month, Microsoft released 59 CVEs in Windows and Windows Components; Office and Office Components; .NET Framework and Visual Studio; Microsoft Dynamics 365; Power BI; DHCP Server; Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based); and Windows Mobile Broadband. If you include the third-party CVEs being documented this month, the CVE count comes to 63. A total of two of these bugs came through the ZDI program. As with last month, none of the bugs disclosed at Pwn2Own Vancouver are fixed with this release. With Apple and <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24280">VMware</a> fixing the vulnerabilities reported during the event, Microsoft stands alone as the only vendor not to produce patches from the contest.</p><p class="">Of the new patches released today, only one is rated Critical, 57 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. This release is roughly a third of the size of last month’s, so hopefully that’s a sign that a huge number of fixes in a single month isn’t going to be a regular occurrence.</p><p class="">Two of the CVEs released today are listed as under active attack, and one other is listed as publicly known at the time of the release. Microsoft doesn’t provide any indication of the volume of attacks, but the DWM Core bug appears to me to be more than a targeted attack. Let’s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with the DWM bug currently exploited in the wild:</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30051" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30051</strong></a><strong> – Windows DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br /></strong>This bug allows attackers to escalate the SYSTEM on affected systems. These types of bugs are usually combined with a code execution bug to take over a target and are often used by ransomware. Microsoft credits four different groups for reporting the bug, which indicates the attacks are widespread. They also indicate the vulnerability is publicly known. Don’t wait to test and deploy this update as exploits are likely to increase now that a patch is available to reverse engineer.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30043" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30043</strong></a><strong> – Microsoft SharePoint Server Information Disclosure Vulnerability<br /></strong>This vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by ZDI researcher Piotr Bazydło and represents an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019. An authenticated attacker could use this bug to read local files with SharePoint Farm service account user privileges. They could also perform an HTTP-based server-side request forgery (SSRF), and – most importantly – perform NLTM relaying as the SharePoint Farm service account. Bugs like this show why info disclosure vulnerabilities shouldn’t be ignored or deprioritized.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30033" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30033</strong></a><strong> – Windows Search Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is another bug reported through the ZDI program and has a similar impact to the bug currently being exploited, although it manifests through a different mechanism. This is a link following bug in the Windows Search service. By creating a pseudo-symlink, an attacker could redirect a delete call to delete a different file or folder as SYSTEM. We discussed how this could be used to elevate privileges <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/3/16/abusing-arbitrary-file-deletes-to-escalate-privilege-and-other-great-tricks" target="_blank">here</a>. The delete happens when restarting the service. A low-privileged user can't restart the service directly. However, this could easily be combined with a bug that allows a low-privileged user to terminate any process by PID. After failure, the service will restart automatically, successfully triggering this vulnerability.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30050" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30050</strong></a><strong> – Windows Mark of the Web Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability<br /></strong>We don’t normally detail Moderate-rated bugs, but this type of security feature bypass is quite in vogue with ransomware gangs right now. They zip their payload to bypass network and host-based defenses, they use a Mark of the Web (MotW) bypass to evade SmartScreen or Protected View in Microsoft Office. While we have no indication this bug is being actively used, we see the technique used often enough to call it out. Bugs like this one show why Moderate-rated bugs shouldn’t be ignored or deprioritized.</p><p class="">Here’s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for May 2024:</p>

  <p class=""><em>* Indicates this CVE had been released by a third party and is now being included in Microsoft releases</em>.</p><p class=""><em>† Indicates further administrative actions are required to fully address the vulnerability.</em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">There’s just one Critical-rated bug this month, and it deals with a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could use this bug to execute arbitrary code in the context of the SharePoint Server. While permissions are needed for this to occur, any authorized user on the server has the needed level of permissions.</p><p class="">Looking at the other RCE bugs, we see a lot of vulnerabilities in rarely used protocols. The Windows Mobile Broadband driver and the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) make up the bulk of this category. More notable are the two bugs in Hyper-V. One of these would allow an authenticated attacker to execute code on the host system. This would result in a guest-to-host escape, but Microsoft doesn’t indicate what level the code execution occurs on the host OS. After a couple of months with many SQL-related fixes, there’s just one this month. As with the previous bugs, you would need to connect to a malicious SQL server. The bug in Cryptographic Services requires a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) but could lead to a malicious certificate being imported onto the target system. The RCE bugs are rounded out with open-and-own style bugs in Excel and .NET and Visual Studio.</p><p class="">Moving on to the elevation of privilege (EoP) patches in this month’s release, almost all lead to SYSTEM-level code execution if an authenticated user runs specially crafted code. While there isn’t a lot else to say about these bugs, they are often used by attackers to take over a system when combined with a code execution bug – like the Excel bug mentioned above. They convince a user to open a specially crafted Excel document that executes the EoP and takes over the system. The lone exception to this is the bug in the Brokering File System component. The vulnerability allows attackers to gain the ability to authenticate against a remote host using the current user’s credentials. The attack could be launched from a low-privileged AppContainer, which would allow the attacker to execute code or access resources at a higher integrity level than that of the AppContainer execution environment.</p><p class="">We’ve already discussed the MotW security feature bypass (SFB), and the only other SFB vulnerability receiving a fix this month is the MSHTML engine. Just when you thought you were safe from Internet Explorer, the Trident engine rears its ugly head. This bug allows an unauthenticated attacker to get code execution if they can convince a user to open a malicious document. The code execution occurs in the context of the user, so this is another reminder not to log on with Admin privileges unless you absolutely need to.</p><p class="">There are only seven information disclosure bugs receiving fixes this month, and we’ve already covered the one in SharePoint. As usual, most of these vulnerabilities only result in info leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. The bug in Power BI could result in the disclosing of “sensitive information,” but Microsoft doesn’t narrow down what type of “sensitive information” could be leaked. Similarly, the bug in Deployment Services could leak “file contents.” Microsoft provides no information on whether that’s any arbitrary file contents or only specific files, so your guess is as good as mine.</p><p class="">The May release includes four spoofing bugs. The first is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bug in Azure Migrate. There’s not a straightforward patch for this one. You need the latest Azure Migrate Agent and ConfigManager updates. More info on how to do that can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/common-questions-appliance#how-to-troubleshoot-auto-update-failures-for-azure-migrate-appliance.">here</a>. There are two spoofing bugs in Dynamics 365, but they read more like XSS bugs. The final spoofing bug addressed this month is in the Bing search engine. An attacker could modify the content of the vulnerable link to redirect the victim to a malicious site.</p><p class="">There’s a single Tampering bug addressed in this release fixing a bug in Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management. An attacker could gain sensitive information on a target device that has been rooted.</p><p class="">The final bugs for May are Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities in ASP.NET, DHCP server, and Hyper-V. Unfortunately, Microsoft provides no additional information about these bugs and how they would manifest on affected systems.</p><p class="">There are no new advisories in this month’s release.</p><p class=""><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p class="">The next Patch Tuesday of 2024 will be on June 11, and I’ll return with details and patch analysis then. Until then, stay safe, happy patching, and may all your reboots be smooth and clean!</p>

<title>The April 2024 Security Updates Review</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/4/9/the-april-2024-security-updates-review</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/4/9/the-april-2024-security-updates-review</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="">It’s the second Tuesday of the month, and Adobe and Microsoft have released a fresh crop of security updates. Take a break from your other activities and join us as we review the details of their latest advisories. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>





















  
  






  <p class=""><strong>Adobe Patches for April 2024</strong></p><p class="">For April, Adobe released nine patches addressing 24 CVEs in Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Commerce, InDesign, Experience Manager, Media Encoder, Bridge, Illustrator, and Adobe Animate. The largest of these updates is for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb24-21.html">Experience Manager</a>, however, all of the bugs being patched are simple Cross-site Scripting (XSS) bugs. Still, if exploited, these Important-severity bugs could lead to code execution if exploited. The only other patches that address multiple CVEs are the fixes for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/animate/apsb24-26.html">Animate</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb24-18.html">Commerce</a>. The patch for Animate addresses four bugs. Two of these are rated Critical and could lead to arbitrary code execution. The patch for Commerce also fixes two Critical-rated bugs, one XSS and one improper input validation bug. Both could lead to code execution. </p><p class="">Then we have several patches that are all info leaks due to an Out-Of-Bounds (OOB) read. These were all reported by the same person, and it makes me wonder if there is shared code between these products that makes them all vulnerable. In any case, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/after_effects/apsb24-09.html">After Effects</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/photoshop/apsb24-16.html">Photoshop</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/indesign/apsb24-20.html">InDesign</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/bridge/apsb24-24.html">Bridge</a>, and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb24-25.html">Illustrator</a> all fall into this category. That just leaves the update for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/media-encoder/apsb24-23.html">Media Encoder</a>. This patch fixes a single buffer overflow that could lead to code execution.</p><p class="">None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3.</p><p class=""><strong>Microsoft Patches for April 2024</strong></p><p class="">This month, Microsoft released a whopping 147 new CVEs in Microsoft Windows and Windows Components; Office and Office Components; Azure; .NET Framework and Visual Studio; SQL Server; DNS Server; Windows Defender; Bitlocker; and Windows Secure Boot. If you include the third-party CVEs being documented this month, the CVE count comes to 155. A total of three of these bugs came through the ZDI program. None of the bugs disclosed at Pwn2Own Vancouver are fixed with this release.</p><p class="">Of the new patches released today, only three are rated Critical, 142 are rated Important, and two are rated Moderate in severity. This is the largest release from Microsoft this year and the largest since at least 2017. As far as I can tell, it’s the largest Patch Tuesday release from Microsoft of all time. It’s not clear if this is due to a backlog from the slower months or a surge in vulnerability reporting. It will be interesting to see which trend continues.</p><p class="">None of the CVEs released today are listed as currently under active attack and none are listed as publicly known at the time of release. However, the bug reported by ZDI threat hunter Peter Girnus was found in the wild. We have evidence this is being exploited in the wild, and I’m listing it as such.</p><p class="">Let’s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with a bug we consider to be currently exploited in the wild:</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29988"><strong>CVE-2024-29988</strong></a><strong> – SmartScreen Prompt Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is an odd one, as a ZDI threat researcher found this vulnerability being in the wild, although Microsoft currently doesn’t list this as exploited. I would treat this as in the wild until Microsoft clarifies. The bug itself acts much like <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/b/cve202421412-water-hydra-targets-traders-with-windows-defender-s.html">CVE-2024-21412</a> – it bypasses the Mark of the Web (MotW) feature and allows malware to execute on a target system. Threat actors are sending exploits in a zipped file to evade EDR/NDR detection and then using this bug (and others) to bypass MotW. </p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-20678"><strong>CVE-2024-20678</strong></a><strong> – Remote Procedure Call Runtime Remote Code Execution Vulnerability<br /></strong>There is a long history of RPC exploits being seen in the wild, so any RPC bug that could lead to code execution turns heads. This bug does require authentication, but it doesn’t require any elevated permission. Any authenticated user could hit it. It’s not clear if you could hit this if you authenticated as Guest or an anonymous user. A quick search shows about 1.3 million systems with TCP port 135 exposed to the internet. I expect a lot of people will be looking to exploit this in short order.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-20670"><strong>CVE-2024-20670</strong></a><strong> – Outlook for Windows Spoofing Vulnerability<br /></strong>This bug is listed as a spoofing bug, but based on the end result of exploitation, I would consider this information disclosure. In this case, the information disclosed would be NTLM hashes, which could then be used for Spoofing targeted users. Either way, a user would need to click something in an email to trigger this vulnerability. The Preview Pane is NOT an attack vector. However, we have seen a rash of NTLM relaying bugs over the last few months. With the wide user base of Outlook, this will likely be targeted by threat actors in the coming months.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-26221"><strong>CVE-2024-26221</strong></a><strong> – Windows DNS Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is one of seven DNS RCE bugs being patched this month and all are documented identically. These bugs allow RCE on an affected DNS server if the attacker has the privileges to query the DNS server. There is a timing factor here as well, but if the DNS queries are timed correctly, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target server. Although not specifically stated, it seems logical that the code execution would occur at the level of the DNS service, which is elevated. I really don’t need to tell you that your DNS servers are critical targets, so please take these bugs seriously and test and deploy the patches quickly.</p><p class="">Here’s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for April 2024:</p><p class=""><em>*Note that post-release, Microsoft confirmed CVE-2024-26234 is also under active attack.

  <p class=""><em>* Indicates this CVE had been released by a third party and is now being included in Microsoft releases</em>.</p><p class=""><em>† Indicates further administrative actions are required to fully address the vulnerability.</em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Moving on to the Critical-rated bugs, all impact Microsoft Defender for IoT. An authenticated attacker with file upload privileges could get arbitrary code execution through a path traversal vulnerability. They would need to upload specially crafted files to sensitive locations on the target. It’s not clear how likely this would be, but anything that targets your defensive tools should be taken seriously.</p><p class="">All told, there are almost 70 fixes for bugs that could lead to code execution in this release. The (somewhat) good news is that nearly half of these impact SQL server components. In these cases, an attacker would need to have an affected system connect to a specially crafted SQL database and perform a query. If you can socially engineer that, then you will get code execution. However, that does seem unlikely. More practically, I would concern myself with the DNS and DHCP code execution bugs in this release. I’ve already mentioned the DNS bugs. For the DHCP bugs, the attacker would need elevated privileges. This would be a good time to audit your DHCP server to see who has privileges and who should be removed. The fix for Azure Migrate is only network adjacent, but you’ll need to take extra steps to be fully protected. You need to the latest Azure Migrate Appliance's AutoUpdater, which ensures MSI installers downloaded from the Download Center have been authentically signed by Microsoft prior to installation. Check <a href="Azure%20Migrate%20Appliance's%20AutoUpdater%20which%20ensures%20MSI%20installers%20downloaded%20from%20the%20Download%20Center%20have%20been%20authentically%20signed%20by%20Microsoft%20prior%20to%20installation.">here</a> for more details. There is an update for Excel to address an open-an-own bug, but you’re out of luck if you’re on macOS. Updates for Apple users are not available yet. </p><p class="">There’s a mountain of elevation of privilege (EoP) patches in this month’s release, and in most cases, exploitation requires an attacker to log on the an affected system then run their code. Again, this usually results in getting code to elevate to SYSTEM. The Azure EoPs are a little bit different and require some extra steps. The bug in Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information, such as Azure IoT Operations secrets and potentially other credentials or access tokens stored within the Kubernetes cluster. You’ll also need to update any affected Extensions that are used in your environment and ensure you update your Azure Arc Agent. The bug in Azure Content Gallery also needs extra actions to be protected. This bug has been mitigated by the latest change to the Azure Compute Gallery (ACG) image creation permission requirements, which means you’ll need to check the permissions and possibly update them. For information on how to update permissions, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries?tabs=vhdsource%2Cazure-cli#what-rbac-permissions-are-required-to-create-an-acg-image">here</a> for details. For the Azure Monitor Agent EoP, you need to make sure you have Automatic Extension Upgrades enabled. If you don’t you can manually get the updates following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage?tabs=azure-portal#update">these</a> instructions. Finally, the bug in the Azure Kubernetes Service also needs some extra work. To be fully protected, you need to ensure you are running the latest version of “az confcom” and Kata Image. If you don’t have “az conform” installed, you can get the latest version by running the command “az extension add -n conform”. See the bulletin for full details.</p><p class="">Moving on to the security feature bypass (SFB) bugs, how in the world are there 23 different SFB patches for Secure Boot? As if that isn’t enough, you’ll need to take additional steps to be protected. The patch fixes the bugs, but the protections aren’t enabled by default. You’ll need to check out this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5025885">KB article</a> and follow the instructions listed there. With 23 bugs and manual actions needed to address them, I don’t think we should call it “secure” boot anymore. Other SFB bugs include one that could bypass RSA signature verification and a bug in BitLocker that could also bypass secure boot. At least that one just requires a patch and no extra steps.</p><p class="">There are more than a dozen information disclosure bugs. Fortunately, most only result in info leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. The bug in Azure AI Search could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive API Keys. While this bug has been mitigated by a recent update to Azure AI Search's backend infrastructure, you’ll need to manually rotate specific credentials that have been notified through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/overview">Azure Service Health</a> alerts. The bug in Azure Identity Library for .NET could divulge data inside the targeted website like IDs, tokens, nonces, and other sensitive information. At least there are no additional steps beyond the patch for this one. Finally, the bug in Windows DFS could disclose the ever-descriptive “sensitive information”.</p><p class="">The April release is rounded out by a handful of spoofing and denial-of-service (DoS) bugs. Microsoft doesn’t provide a lot of useful information here, but if you need to focus on something, the DoS bugs in the DHCP service are where I’d start. Shutting down DHCP for any time in an enterprise will likely lead to a “no fun at all” day.</p><p class="">Finally, Microsoft has updated <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/advisory/ADV990001">ADV99001</a> with the latest servicing stack updates. Be sure to check them out. </p><p class=""><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p class="">The next Patch Tuesday of 2024 will be on May 14, and I’ll return with details and patch analysis then. Until then, stay safe, happy patching, and may all your reboots be smooth and clean!</p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key Takeaways&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Attacks on the software supply chain have occurred at a rate of at least one every two days in 2024.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>U.S. companies and IT providers have been by far the most frequent targets, accounting for one-third of all software supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The UK, Australia, Germany, India and Japan have also been frequent targets, as have the aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare and manufacturing sectors.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>These <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/">cyber attacks</a> are particularly damaging and costly because of their multiplication factor on downstream victims and trusted access to customer environments.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Even when the codebase isn’t breached, customer databases contain critical information for threat actors to use in phishing, spoofing and credential attacks. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>A defense-in-depth approach is required to reduce risk, based on principles of <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-zero-trust-framework/">zero trust</a>, cyber resilience, and secure code practices.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Software supply chain attacks burst into public consciousness in 2020 with news of the SolarWinds Orion attack, and a Kaseya VSA ransomware attack in mid-2021 further underscored the risks that third-party software suppliers can pose to their unsuspecting customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Attacks resulting from infiltration of an IT supplier’s code base are relatively rare, but the software supply chain – the code, dependencies and applications that all modern organizations rely on – is a source of near-constant vulnerabilities and cyberattacks that place all organizations at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of their trusted access to IT environments, a category of security tools called third-party risk management (TPRM) has evolved to monitor the security of trusted providers – and to alert downstream users when the risk from these services has increased.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of their trusted access to customer environments, third-party providers are one of the biggest targets for threat actors. While codebase breaches are relatively rare, a breach of any partner’s business environment can lead to sensitive data being leaked that could give attackers a critical advantage in breaching other environments, including <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-phishing/">phishing</a>, spoofing and credential attacks. And because of the interconnectedness and increasing digital nature of the physical supply chain, any manufacturer or supplier with downstream distribution can be considered a cyber risk. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We’ll look at the frequency and nature of supply chain attacks in 2024 before we focus on important defenses that all organizations with trusted partners should have in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Common Are Software Supply Chain Attacks?&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Successful supply chain attacks have become a near-daily occurrence in 2024, according to Cyble <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-cyber-threat-intelligence/">threat intelligence</a> data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble’s <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/dark-web-monitoring/">dark web monitoring</a> found 90 cybercriminal claims of successful supply chain attacks in a six-month period that encompassed February 2024 to mid-August 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not surprising given their reach, IT providers suffered the greatest number of those breaches, 30, or one-third of the total, followed by technology product companies, which experienced 14 of the 90 breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aerospace &amp; defense (9 breaches), manufacturing (9 breaches), and healthcare (8 breaches) were the next most frequent victims of supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In all, 22 of the 25 sectors tracked by Cyble threat researchers have experienced a supply chain attack in 2024 (chart below).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The U.S. experienced by far the greatest number of supply chain breaches claimed on the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-the-dark-web/">dark web</a> – 31 in all – followed by the UK (10). Germany and Australia each had five, and Japan and India had four each.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Look at the Nature of Supply Chain Attacks in 2024&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Supply chain attacks in 2024 have ranged from the theft of business and customer data to the theft and hijacking of source code, but regardless of the sensitive data access, all such attacks pose a serious threat because of the reach of these suppliers. A recent report from Cyentia found that 99% of Global 2000 companies are directly connected to a vendor that has been hit by a supply chain breach. Here is a look at the range and nature of supply chain attacks and breaches thus far in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">jQuery&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 5, a supply chain attack on the JavaScript npm package manager involving trojanized versions of jQuery was discovered by cybersecurity researchers. The attack targeted the popular JavaScript library jQuery by distributing trojanized versions through npm, GitHub, and jsDelivr. The attackers modified the legitimate jQuery code to exfiltrate sensitive form data from websites. The attack's scope was significant, impacting multiple platforms and package names. The attackers used tactics like obfuscation and misleading version warnings. The attack underscored the urgent need for developers and website owners to verify package authenticity and scrutinize code for suspicious modifications to mitigate supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Polyfill&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In late June, a widespread supply chain attack hit over 100,000 websites, including many well-known names, originating from a fake domain that impersonated the Polyfill.js library to inject malware that redirected users to sports betting or pornographic sites. The malware dynamically generated based on HTTP headers, making detection challenging. The attack highlighted the risks of using external code libraries and the importance of vigilance in website security. Mitigation steps included removing cdn.polyfill.io, replacing it with secure alternatives, and caution against relying on unknown entities for JavaScript. The incident underscored the security implications of third-party scripts and the potential for malicious takeovers of widely deployed projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Programming Language Breach&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 26, <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/">threat actor </a>(TA) IntelBroker, posting on the BreachForums cybercrime forum, claimed to offer unauthorized access to a node package manager (npm) and GitHub account pertaining to an undisclosed programming language, for US $20,000. The TA said the offer also includes access to the X (Twitter) account of the associated organization with about 100,000 followers, and private repositories with privileges to push and clone commits. Below is a screenshot of the TA’s claims: </p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CDK Global Inc.&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 19, automotive dealership software provider CDK Global Inc. was hit by a <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack reportedly perpetrated by the Black Suit ransomware group that disrupted sales and inventory operations of many North American auto dealers, including large dealer networks belong to Group1 Automotive Inc., AutoNation Inc., Premier Truck Group, and Sonic Automotive, all of which informed U.S. authorities that they experienced a multi-week service outage and disruption to dealership operations, including those supporting sales, customer relationship management systems, inventory and accounting functions. However, none of the CDK Global customers reported any malicious activity within their networks, suggesting the attack may have been limited to a service disruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Insula Group Pty Ltd.&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 25, BianLian ransomware group claimed to compromise Australia-based Insula Group Pty Ltd. The company provides software solutions used in residential construction and finance broking industries. The ransomware group allegedly exfiltrated 400 GB of documents that included project data, construction data, client information, server data, and company source code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Access Offered to More than 400 Companies&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 15, IntelBroker, again appearing on BreachForums, offered to sell unauthorized access to more than 400 companies compromised via an undisclosed third-party contractor. The data allegedly included access to integration services of Jira, Bamboo, Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, SSH, SFTP, DA, Zabbix, AWS S3, AWS EC2, SVN and Terraform. Additionally, the TA also provided revenue of four significant impacted organizations. Open-source research based on the companies’ revenue and location suggested the impacted organizations could be Lockheed Martin Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, General Dynamics, and Apple Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Smart-ID&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 21, the functionality of the Smart-ID electronic identification and authorization app was disrupted after a cyberattack, resulting in difficulties accessing internet banking and other e-services in Latvia, Estonia and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cartier International SNC&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On Aug 5, IntelBroker leaked data on BreachForums allegedly pertaining to Cartier International SNC, a France-based luxury goods brand. The TA said the data was stolen from the U.S,-based BORN Group, a global digital marketing agency that specializes in digital transformation and commerce solutions. The TA claimed the data was exfiltrated from AWS S3 storage and also leveraged a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, which led to the exposure of internal files, images, and source code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Code Base Injection Not Required for Supply Chain Attack&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Threat actors don’t need to inject malicious code into a tech company’s code base to hack the software supply chain – they only need to exploit a zero-day or unpatched flaw that already exists, as happened in recent attacks hitting customers of MOVEit and Ivanti. And “software dependences,” like an open-source component used in proprietary software, can also introduce vulnerabilities, further expanding the attack surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The software supply chain falls under the broader category of third-party risk management (TPRM), the partners, vendors, service providers, suppliers and contractors who can unwittingly introduce risk into an organization’s environment. A number of studies have found that more than half of all organizations have experienced a third-party breach, and these breaches tend to be more costly than incidents that occur within an organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here are some of the best practices and technologies organizations can use to protect against these growing third-party risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Zero Trust and Cyber Resilience Help Control Supply Chain Risks&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity,</a> organizations should always “assume breach” and trust no one, and this applies to third-party partners too. If security teams assume that no one can be trusted and that no one can be given safe access to assets, they architect accordingly, with critical systems and data isolated with security controls and duplicated with ransomware-resistant backups.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The concept of <em>cyber resilience</em> has been repeatedly stressed in recent years. Instead of focusing solely on the network perimeter and endpoints, resilience and recovery should be built around critical applications and data using practices such as:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Network microsegmentation&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Strong access controls, allowing no more access than is required, with frequent verification&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>A strong source of user identity and authentication, including multi-factor authentication and biometrics, <em>and</em> machine authentication with device compliance and health checks&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Encryption of data at rest and in transit&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Ransomware-resistant backups that are immutable, air-gapped and isolated as much as possible&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Honeypots that lure attackers to fake assets for early breach detection&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Proper configuration of API and cloud service connections&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Monitor for unusual activity with SIEM, Active Directory monitoring, and data loss prevention (DLP) tools&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Routinely assessing and confirming controls through audits, vulnerability scanning and penetration tests&nbsp;</li>

<p>Carefully vetting your partners and suppliers and requiring good security controls in contracts are ways to improve third-party security. <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/cyber-threat-intelligence/">Cyber threat intelligence</a> services like Cyble will help you assess partner and vendor risk – and alert you to places where you may want to shore up your own security defenses. Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence module evaluates partner security in areas such as cyber hygiene, dark web exposure, spoofing activities, and attack surface and network exposure, noting specific areas for improvement, while Cyble’s AI-powered vulnerability scanning capabilities can help you find and prioritize your own web-facing vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a number of guides on supply chain risk management and best practices. These are important resources both for developers and companies evaluating third-party providers. Make security reviews and requirements part of your procurement process from the start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are some questions you should ask vendors and service providers as part of a digital supply chain risk assessment:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Is the vendor’s software and hardware design process documented, repeatable and measurable?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Does the vendor maintain a software component inventory such as a software bill of materials (SBOM) that spells out the components and other attributes of software developed by the vendor and third parties?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Is the mitigation of known vulnerabilities factored into product design through product architecture, run-time protection techniques, and code review?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How does the vendor stay current on emerging vulnerabilities? What are vendor capabilities to address new <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/zero-day-exploit/">“zero day” vulnerabilities?</a>&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What controls are in place to manage and monitor production processes?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How is configuration management performed? Quality assurance? How is testing done for code quality and vulnerabilities?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What levels of <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/">malware </a>protection and detection are performed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What steps are taken to make sure products are tamper-proof? Are the back doors closed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Are physical security measures documented and audited?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What access controls, both cyber and physical, are in place? Are they documented and audited?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How is customer data protected, stored, retained, and destroyed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What type of employee background checks are conducted and how frequently?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What security practice expectations are there for upstream suppliers, and how is adherence to these standards assessed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How secure is the distribution process? Have approved and authorized distribution channels been clearly documented?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Services like Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence can help you get started on this process. As more organizations make security a buying criterion, vendors will be forced to respond with better security controls and documentation.&nbsp;</p>
