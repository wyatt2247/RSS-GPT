<p>Not long ago, the ability to digitally track someone’s daily movements just by knowing their home address, employer, or place of worship was considered a dangerous power that should remain only within the purview of nation states. But a new lawsuit in a likely constitutional battle over a New Jersey privacy law shows that anyone can now access this capability, thanks to a proliferation of commercial services that hoover up the digital exhaust emitted by widely-used mobile apps and websites.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69282" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69282" height="756" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/peoplephone.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69282">Image: Shutterstock, Arthimides.</p></div>
<p>Delaware-based<strong> Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</strong> helps its users remove their personal information from the clutches of consumer data brokers, and from <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=people+search" rel="noopener" target="_blank">people-search services online</a>. Backed by millions of dollars in litigation financing, Atlas so far this year has sued 151 consumer data brokers on behalf of a class that includes more than 20,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers who are signed up for Atlas services.</p>
<p>Atlas alleges all of these data brokers have ignored repeated warnings that they are violating <strong>Daniel’s Law</strong>, a New Jersey statute allowing law enforcement, government personnel, judges and their families to have their information completely removed from commercial data brokers. Daniel’s Law was passed in 2020 after the death of 20-year-old <strong>Daniel Anderl</strong>, who was killed in a violent attack targeting a federal judge &#8212; his mother.</p>
<p>Last week, Atlas invoked Daniel&#8217;s Law in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.18_Babel_Street_Compl_w_Summons-Case_Info_-_4874-8628-4017_-_1__1_.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a> (PDF) against <strong>Babel Street</strong>, a little-known technology company incorporated in Reston, Va. Babel Street&#8217;s core product allows customers to draw a digital polygon around nearly any location on a map of the world, and view a slighted dated (by a few days) time-lapse history of the mobile devices seen coming in and out of the specified area.</p>
<p>Babel Street’s <strong>LocateX</strong> platform also allows customers to track individual mobile users by their <strong>Mobile Advertising ID</strong> or <strong>MAID</strong>, a unique, alphanumeric identifier built into all Google Android and Apple mobile devices.</p>
<p>Babel Street can offer this tracking capability by consuming location data and other identifying information that is collected by many websites and broadcast to dozens and sometimes hundreds of ad networks that may wish to bid on showing their ad to a particular user.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69280" style="width: 1458px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69280" height="990" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/mosque.jpeg" width="1448" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69280">This image, taken from a video recording Atlas made of its private investigator using Babel Street to show all of the unique mobile IDs seen over time at a mosque in Dearborn, Michigan. Each red dot represents one mobile device.</p></div>
<p>In an interview, Atlas said a private investigator they hired was offered a free trial of Babel Street, which the investigator was able to use to determine the home address and daily movements of mobile devices belonging to multiple New Jersey police officers whose families have already faced significant harassment and death threats.</p>
<p>Atlas said the investigator encountered Babel Street while testing hundreds of data broker tools and services to see if personal information on its users was being sold. They soon discovered Babel Street also bundles people-search services with its platform, to make it easier for customers to zero in on a specific device.</p>
<p>The investigator contacted Babel Street about possibly buying home addresses in certain areas of New Jersey. After listening to a sales pitch for Babel Street and expressing interest, the investigator was told Babel Street only offers their service to the government or to “contractors of the government.”</p>
<p>“The investigator (truthfully) mentioned that he was contemplating some government contract work in the future and was told by the Babel Street salesperson that ‘that’s good enough’ and that ‘they don’t actually check,’” Atlas shared in an email with reporters.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity was one of five media outlets invited to review screen recordings that Atlas made while its investigator used a two-week trial version of Babel Street’s LocateX service. References and links to reporting by other publications, including <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-u-s-government-bought-tool-that-can-track-phones-at-abortion-clinics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>404 Media</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.haaretz.co.il/news/security/2024-10-23/ty-article-magazine/.premium/00000192-b90c-dc97-a593-f96f50800000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Haaretz</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.notus.org/technology/cell-phone-tracking-law-enforcement-abortion-clinic" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>NOTUS</strong></a>, and <strong>The New York Times</strong>, will appear throughout this story.</p>
<p>Collectively, these stories expose how the broad availability of mobile advertising data has created a market in which virtually anyone can build a sophisticated spying apparatus capable of tracking the daily movements of hundreds of millions of people globally.</p>
<p>The findings outlined in Atlas&#8217;s lawsuit against Babel Street also illustrate how mobile location data is set to massively complicate several hot-button issues, from the tracking of suspected illegal immigrants or women seeking abortions, to harassing public servants who are already in the crosshairs over baseless conspiracy theories and increasingly hostile political rhetoric against government employees.</p>
<h2>WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE</h2>
<p>Atlas says the Babel Street trial period allowed its investigator to find information about visitors to high-risk targets such as mosques, synagogues, courtrooms and abortion clinics. In one video, an Atlas investigator showed how they isolated mobile devices seen in a New Jersey courtroom parking lot that was reserved for jurors, and then tracked one likely juror’s phone to their home address over several days.</p>
<p>While the Atlas investigator had access to its trial account at Babel Street, they were able to successfully track devices belonging to several plaintiffs named or referenced in the lawsuit. They did so by drawing a digital polygon around the home address or workplace of each person in Babel Street’s platform, which focused exclusively on the devices that passed through those addresses each day.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69273" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69273" height="648" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sinai-temple.jpeg" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69273">Each red dot in this Babel Street map represents a unique mobile device that has been seen since April 2022 at a Jewish synagogue in Los Angeles, Calif. Image: Atlas Data Privacy Corp.</p></div>
<p>One unique feature of Babel Street is the ability to toggle a “night” mode, which makes it relatively easy to determine within a few meters where a target typically lays their head each night (because their phone is usually not far away).</p>
<p>Atlas plaintiffs <strong>Scott</strong> and <strong>Justyna Maloney</strong> are both veteran officers with the Rahway, NJ police department who live together with their two young children. In April 2023, Scott and Justyna became the target of intense harassment and death threats after Officer Justyna responded to a routine call about a man filming people outside of the Motor Vehicle Commission in Rahway.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfEZWtC9bdI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">man filming</a> the Motor Vehicle Commission that day is a social media personality who often solicits police contact and then records himself arguing about constitutional rights with the responding officers.</p>
<p>Officer Justyna’s interaction with the man was entirely peaceful, and the episode appeared to end without incident. But after a selectively edited video of that encounter went viral, their home address and unpublished phone numbers were posted online. When their tormentors figured out that Scott was also a cop (a sergeant), the couple began receiving dozens of threatening text messages, including specific death threats.</p>
<p>According to the Atlas lawsuit, one of the messages to Mr. Maloney demanded money, and warned that his family would &#8220;pay in blood&#8221; if he didn’t comply. Sgt. Maloney said he then received a video in which a masked individual pointed a rifle at the camera and told him that his family was &#8220;going to get [their] heads cut off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maloney said a few weeks later, one of their neighbors saw two suspicious individuals in ski masks parked one block away from the home and alerted police. Atlas’s complaint says video surveillance from neighboring homes shows the masked individuals circling the Maloney’s home. The responding officers arrested two men, who were armed, for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69289" style="width: 758px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69289" height="437" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/babelstbldg.png" width="748" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69289">According to Google Maps, Babel Street shares a corporate address with Google and the consumer credit reporting bureau TransUnion.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said their investigator was not able to conclusively find Scott Maloney’s iPhone in the Babel Street platform, but they did find Justyna’s. Babel Street had nearly 100,000 hits for her phone over several months, allowing Atlas to piece together an intimate picture of Justyna’s daily movements and meetings with others.<span id="more-69216"></span></p>
<p>An Atlas investigator visited the Maloneys and inspected Justyna’s iPhone, and determined the only app that used her device’s location data was from the department store <strong>Macy’s</strong>.</p>
<p>In a written response to questions, Macy&#8217;s said its app includes an opt-in feature for geo-location, &#8220;which allows customers to receive an enhanced shopping experience based on their location.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not store any customer location information,&#8221; Macy&#8217;s wrote. &#8220;We share geo-location data with a <a href="https://www.macys.com/ads.txt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limited number of partners</a> who help us deliver this enhanced app experience. Furthermore, we have no connection with Babel Street&#8221; [link added for context].</p>
<p>Justyna’s experience highlights a stark reality about the broad availability of mobile location data: Even if the person you’re looking for isn’t directly identifiable in platforms like Babel Street, it is likely that at least some of that person’s family members are. In other words, it’s often trivial to infer the location of one device by successfully locating another.</p>
<p>The terms of service for Babel Street’s Locate X service state that the product &#8220;may not be used as the basis for any legal process in any country, including as the basis for a warrant, subpoena, or any other legal or administrative action.&#8221; But Scott Maloney said he’s convinced by their experience that not even law enforcement agencies should have access to this capability without a warrant.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a law enforcement officer, in order for me to track someone I need a judge to sign a warrant &#8211; and that&#8217;s for a criminal investigation after we&#8217;ve developed probable cause,&#8221; Mr. Maloney said in an interview. &#8220;Data brokers tracking me and my family just to sell that information for profit, without our consent, and even after we&#8217;ve explicitly asked them not to is deeply disturbing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Maloney’s law enforcement colleagues in other states may see things differently. In August, <strong>The Texas Observer</strong> <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-dps-surveillance-tangle-cobwebs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that state police plan to spend more than $5 million on a contract for a controversial surveillance tool called <strong>Tangles</strong> from the tech firm PenLink. Tangles is an AI-based web platform that scrapes information from the open, deep and dark web, and it has a premier feature called <strong>WebLoc</strong> that can be used to geofence mobile devices.</p>
<p>The <strong>Associated Press</strong> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27ef" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported last month</a> that law enforcement agencies from suburban Southern California to rural North Carolina have been using an obscure cell phone tracking tool called <strong>Fog Reveal</strong> — at times without warrants — that gives them the ability to follow people’s movements going back many months.</p>
<p>It remains unclear precisely how Babel Street is obtaining the abundance of mobile location data made available to users of its platform. The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>But according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2020-HQFO-01656.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a document</a> (PDF) obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request with the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Science and Technology directorate, Babel Street re-hosts data from the commercial phone tracking firm <strong>Venntel</strong>.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Substack newsletter <strong>All-Source Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_29FTC124C0060_2900_-NONE-_-NONE-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unearthed documents</a> indicating that the <strong>U.S. Federal Trade Commission</strong> has opened an inquiry into Venntel and its parent company Gravy Analytics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Venntel has also been a data partner of the police surveillance contractor Fog Data Science, whose product has been described as ‘mass surveillance on a budget,'&#8221; All-Source&#8217;s <strong>Jack Poulson</strong> <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/ftc-opened-investigation-into-commercial" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a>. &#8220;Venntel was also reported to have been a primary data source of the controversial ‘Locate X’ phone tracking product of the American data fusion company Babel Street.&#8221;</p>
<h2>MAID IN HELL</h2>
<p>The Mobile Advertising ID or MAID — the unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each mobile device — was originally envisioned as a way to distinguish individual mobile customers without relying on personally identifiable information such as phone numbers or email addresses.</p>
<p>However, there is now <a href="https://datarade.ai/data-categories/device-graph-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a robust industry</a> of marketing and advertising companies that specialize in assembling enormous lists of MAIDs that are &#8220;enriched&#8221; with historical and personal information about the individual behind each MAID.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69270" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69270" height="411" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bigdbm-us-maid.png" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69270">One of many vendors that &#8220;enrich&#8221; MAID data with other identifying information, including name, address, email address and phone number.</p></div>
<p>Atlas said its investigator wanted to know whether they could find enriched MAID records on their New Jersey law enforcement customers, and soon found plenty of ad data brokers willing to sell it.</p>
<p>Some vendors offered only a handful of data fields, such as first and last name, MAID and email address. Other brokers sold far more detailed histories along with their MAID, including each subject’s social media profiles, precise GPS coordinates, and even likely consumer category.</p>
<p>How are advertisers and data brokers gaining access to so much information? Some sources of MAID data can be apps on your phone such as <strong>AccuWeather</strong>, <strong>GasBuddy</strong>, <strong>Grindr</strong>, and <strong>MyFitnessPal</strong> that collect your MAID and location and sell that to brokers.</p>
<p>A user&#8217;s MAID profile and location data also is commonly shared as a consequence of simply using a smartphone to visit a web page that features ads. In the few milliseconds before those ads load, the website will send a &#8220;<strong>bid request</strong>&#8221; to various ad exchanges, where advertisers can bid on the chance to place their ad in front of users who match the consumer profiles they’re seeking. A great deal of data can be included in a bid request, including the user&#8217;s precise location (the current open standard for bid requests is detailed <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>The trouble is that virtually anyone can access the &#8220;bidstream&#8221; data flowing through these so-called &#8220;<strong>realtime bidding</strong>&#8221; networks, because the information is simultaneously broadcast in the clear to hundreds of entities around the world.</p>
<p>The result is that there are a number of marketing companies that now enrich and broker access to this mobile location information. Earlier this year, the German news outlet <strong>netzpolitik.org</strong> purchased a bidstream data set containing more than 3.6 billion data points, and shared the information with the German daily <strong>BR24</strong>. They concluded that the data they obtained (through a free trial, no less) made it possible to establish movement profiles — some of them quite precise — of <a href="https://interaktiv.br.de/ausspioniert-mit-standortdaten/en/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">several million people across Germany</a>.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69268" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69268" height="492" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/br24-netzpolitik.png" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69268">A screenshot from the BR24/Netzpolitik story about their ability to track millions of Germans, including many employees of the German Federal Police and Interior Ministry.</p></div>
<p><strong>Politico</strong> recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2024/09/23/tk-alfred-top-00180521" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered</a> startling <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4941708" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research</a> from universities in New Hampshire, Kentucky and St. Louis that showed how the mobile advertising data they acquired allowed them to link visits from investigators with the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) to insiders selling stock before the investigations became public knowledge.</p>
<p>The researchers in that study said they didn&#8217;t attempt to use the same methods to track regulators from other agencies, but that virtually anyone could do it.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Sherman</strong>, a distinguished fellow at Georgetown Law&#8217;s Center for Privacy and Technology, called the research a &#8220;shocking demonstration of what happens when companies can freely harvest Americans’ geolocation data and sell it for their chosen price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Politicians should understand how they, their staff, and public servants are threatened by the sale of personal data—and constituent groups should realize that talk of data broker &#8216;controls&#8217; or &#8216;best practices&#8221; is designed by companies to distract from the underlying problems and the comprehensive privacy and security solutions, Sherman <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/data-brokers-and-threats-to-government-employees" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote for Lawfare this week</a>.</p>
<h2>A BIDSTREAM DRAGNET?</h2>
<p>The Orwellian nature of modern mobile advertising networks may soon have far-reaching implications for women’s reproductive rights, as more states move to outlaw abortion within their borders. The 2022 Dobbs decision by the U.S. Supreme Court discarded the federal right to abortion, and 14 states have since enacted strict abortion bans.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups are already using mobile advertising data to advance their cause. In May 2023, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://archive.is/IZenH" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that an anti-abortion group in Wisconsin used precise geolocation data to direct ads to women it suspected of seeking abortions.</p>
<p>As it stands, there is little to stop antiabortion groups from purchasing bidstream data (or renting access to a platform like Babel Street) and using it to geofence abortion clinics, potentially revealing all mobile devices transiting through these locations.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator geofenced an abortion clinic and was able to identify a likely employee at that clinic, following their daily route to and from that individual&#8217;s home address.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69272" style="width: 1610px;"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-69272 size-full" height="1195" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ab-clinic-employee.jpeg" width="1600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69272">A still shot from a video Atlas shared of its use of Babel Street to identify and track an employee traveling each day between their home and the clinic.</p></div>
<p>Last year, Idaho became the first state to outlaw &#8220;abortion trafficking,&#8221; which the <strong>Idaho Capital Sun</strong> <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/08/26/helping-a-minor-travel-for-an-abortion-some-states-have-made-it-a-crime/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> is defined as &#8220;recruiting, harboring or transporting a pregnant minor to get an abortion or abortion medication without parental permission.&#8221; Tennessee now has a similar law, and GOP lawmakers in five other states introduced abortion trafficking bills that failed to advance this year, the Sun reports.</p>
<p>Atlas said its investigator used Babel Street to identify and track a person traveling from their home in Alabama &#8212; where abortion is now illegal &#8212; to an abortion clinic just over the border in Tallahassee, Fla. &#8212; and back home again within a few hours. Abortion rights advocates and providers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/nx-s1-5082217/can-alabama-prosecute-someone-for-helping-people-travel-out-of-state-for-an-abortion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are currently suing Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall</a>, seeking to block him from prosecuting people who help patients travel out-of-state to end pregnancies.</p>
<p><strong>Eva Galperin</strong>, director of cybersecurity at the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation </strong>(EFF), a non-profit digital rights group, said she’s extremely concerned about dragnet surveillance of people crossing state lines in order to get abortions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Specifically, Republican officials from states that have outlawed abortion have made it clear that they are interested in targeting people who have gone to neighboring states in order to get abortions, and to make it more difficult for people who are seeking abortions to go to neighboring states,&#8221; Galperin said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a great leap to imagine that states will do this.&#8221;</p>
<h2>APPLES AND GOOGLES</h2>
<p>Atlas found that for the right price (typically $10-50k a year), brokers can provide access to tens of billions of data points covering large swaths of the US population and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Based on the data sets Atlas acquired — many of which included older MAID records — they estimate they could locate roughly 80 percent of Android-based devices, and about 25 percent of Apple phones. Google refers to its MAID as the &#8220;<strong>Android Advertising ID</strong>,&#8221; (AAID) while Apple calls it the &#8220;<strong>Identifier for Advertisers</strong>&#8221; (IDFA).</p>
<p>What accounts for the disparity between the number of Android and Apple devices that can be found in mobile advertising data? In April 2021, Apple shipped version 14.5 of its iOS operating system, which introduced a technology called <strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong> (ATT) that requires apps to get affirmative consent before they can track users by their IDFA or any other identifier.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s introduction of ATT had a swift and profound impact on the advertising market: Less than a year later Facebook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that the iPhone privacy feature would decrease the company’s 2022 revenues by about $10 billion.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69274" style="width: 890px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69274" height="324" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fb-2022-down10b.png" width="880" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69274">Source: cnbc.com.</p></div>
<p>Google runs by far the world&#8217;s largest ad exchange, known as <strong>AdX</strong>. The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>, which has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/technology/google-ad-antitrust-trial-arguments.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accused Google of building a monopoly</a> over the technology that places ads on websites, estimates that Google&#8217;s ad exchange controls 47 percent of the U.S. market and 56 percent globally.</p>
<p>According to recent figures, Google&#8217;s <strong>Android</strong> is also the dominant mobile operating system worldwide, with more than 72 percent of the market. In the U.S., however, iPhone users claim approximately 55 percent of the market, according to <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ios-vs-android-market-share/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TechRepublic</a>.</p>
<p>In response to requests for comment, Google said it does not send real time bidding requests to Babel Street, nor does it share precise location data in bid requests. The company added that its policies explicitly prohibit the sale of data from real-time bidding, or its use for any purpose other than advertising.</p>
<p>Google said its MAIDs are randomly generated and do not contain IP addresses, GPS coordinates, or any other location data, and that its ad systems do not share anyone’s precise location data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Android has clear controls for users to manage app access to device location, and reset or delete their advertising ID,&#8221; Google’s written statement reads. &#8220;If we learn that someone, whether an app developer, ad tech company or anyone else, is violating our policies, we take appropriate action. Beyond that, we support legislation and industry collaboration to address these types of data practices that negatively affect the entire mobile ecosystem, including all operating systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a written statement shared with reporters, Apple said Location Services is not on by default in its devices. Rather, users must enable Location Services and must give permission to each app or website to use location data. Users can turn Location Services off at any time, and can change whether apps have access to location at any time. The user&#8217;s choices include precise vs. approximate location, as well as a one-time grant of location access by the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and build privacy protections into each of our products and services to put the user in control of their data,&#8221; an Apple spokesperson said. &#8220;We minimize personal data collection, and where possible, process data only on users’ devices.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Zach Edwards</strong> is a senior threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm <strong>SilentPush</strong> who has studied the location data industry closely. Edwards said Google and Apple can&#8217;t keep pretending like the MAIDs being broadcast into the bidstream from hundreds of millions of American devices aren’t making most people trivially trackable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The privacy risks here will remain until Apple and Google permanently turn off their mobile advertising ID schemes and admit to the American public that this is the technology that has been supporting the global data broker ecosystem,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>STATES ACT, WHILE CONGRESS DITHERS</h2>
<p>According to <strong>Bloomberg Law</strong>, between 2019 and 2023, threats against federal judges have more than doubled. Amid increasingly hostile political rhetoric and conspiracy theories against government officials, a growing number of states are <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/cops-battle-data-brokers-for-privacy-in-constitutional-clash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seeking to pass their own versions of Daniel’s Law</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, a retired <strong>West Virginia</strong> police officer <a href="https://therecord.media/west-virginia-law-enforcement-sues-broker" rel="noopener" target="_blank">filed a class action lawsuit</a> against the people-search service Whitepages for listing their personal information in violation of a statute the state passed in 2021 that largely mirrors Daniel’s Law.</p>
<p>In May 2024, Maryland passed the <strong>Judge Andrew F. Wilkinson Judicial Security Act</strong> — named after a county circuit court judge who was murdered by an individual involved in a divorce proceeding over which he was presiding. The law allows current and former members of the Maryland judiciary to request their personal information not be made available to the public.</p>
<p>Under the Maryland law, personal information can include a home address; telephone number, email address; Social Security number or federal tax ID number; bank account or payment card number; a license plate or other unique vehicle identifier; a birth or marital record; a child’s name, school, or daycare; place of worship; place of employment for a spouse, child, or dependent.</p>
<p>The law firm <strong>Troutman Pepper</strong> <a href="https://www.troutman.com/insights/maryland-enacts-the-judge-andrew-f-wilkinson-judicial-security-act-are-more-daniels-laws-on-the-horizon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">writes</a> that &#8220;so far in 2024, 37 states have begun considering or have adopted similar privacy-based legislation designed to protect members of the judiciary and, in some states, other government officials involved in law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Atlas alleges that in response to requests to have data on its New Jersey law enforcement clients scrubbed from consumer records sold by <strong>LexisNexis</strong>, the data broker retaliated by freezing the credit of approximately 18,500 people, and falsely reporting them as identity theft victims.</p>
<p>In addition, Atlas said LexisNexis started returning failure codes indicating they had no record of these individuals, resulting in denials when officers attempted to refinance loans or open new bank accounts.</p>
<p>The data broker industry has responded by having at least 70 of the Atlas lawsuits moved to federal court, and challenging the constitutionality of the New Jersey statute as overly broad and a violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the data broker industry argued in their motion to dismiss that there is “no First Amendment doctrine that exempts a content-based restriction from strict scrutiny just because it has some nexus with a privacy interest.”</p>
<p>Atlas&#8217;s lawyers responded that data covered under Daniel&#8217;s Law &#8212; personal information of New Jersey law enforcement officers &#8212; is not free speech. Atlas notes that while defending against comparable lawsuits, the data broker industry has argued that home address and phone number data are not &#8220;communications.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Data brokers should not be allowed to argue that information like addresses are not &#8216;communications&#8217; in one context, only to turn around and claim that addresses are protectable communications,&#8221; Atlas <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/5.-PLAINTIFFS-MEMORANDUM-OF-LAW-IN-OPPOSITION-TO-DEFENDANTS-CONSOLIDATED-MOTION-TO-DISMISS-PLAINTIFFS-COMPLAINT.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">argued</a> (PDF). &#8220;Nor can their change of course alter the reality that the data at issue is not speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge overseeing the challenge is expected to rule on the motion to dismiss within the next few weeks. Regardless of the outcome, the decision is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, media law experts say they’re concerned that enacting Daniel’s Law in other states could limit the ability of journalists to hold public officials accountable, and allow authorities <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/09/21/judge-declines-to-limit-daniels-law-for-reporters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to pursue criminal charges against media outlets</a> that publish the same type of public and government records that fuel the people-search industry.</p>
<p><strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.) said Congress&#8217; failure to regulate data brokers, and the administration&#8217;s continued opposition to bipartisan legislation that would limit data sales to law enforcement, have created this current privacy crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether location data is being used to identify and expose closeted gay Americans, or to track people as they cross state lines to seek reproductive health care, data brokers are selling Americans&#8217; deepest secrets and exposing them to serious harm, all for a few bucks,” Wyden said in a statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, 404 Media, Haaretz, NOTUS, and The New York Times.</p>
<p>Sen. Wyden said Google also deserves blame for refusing to follow Apple&#8217;s lead by removing companies&#8217; ability to track phones.</p>
<p>“Google&#8217;s insistence on uniquely tracking Android users &#8211; and allowing ad companies to do so as well &#8211; has created the technical foundations for the surveillance economy and the abuses stemming from it,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>Georgetown Law&#8217;s Justin Sherman said the data broker and mobile ad industries claim there are protections in place to anonymize mobile location data and restrict access to it, and that there are limits to the kinds of invasive inferences one can make from location data. The data broker industry also likes to tout the usefulness of mobile location data in fighting retail fraud, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;All kinds of things can be inferred from this data, including people being targeted by abusers, or people with a particular health condition or religious belief,&#8221; Sherman said. &#8220;You can track jurors, law enforcement officers visiting the homes of suspects, or military intelligence people meeting with their contacts. The notion that the sale of all this data is preventing harm and fraud is hilarious in light of all the harm it causes enabling people to better target their cyber operations, or learning about people&#8217;s extramarital affairs and extorting public officials.&#8221;</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>Privacy experts say disabling or deleting your device&#8217;s MAID will have no effect on how your phone operates, except that you may begin to see far less targeted ads on that device.</p>
<p>Any Android apps with permission to use your location should appear when you navigate to the Settings app, Location, and then App Permissions. &#8220;Allowed all the time&#8221; is the most permissive setting, followed by &#8220;Allowed only while in use,&#8221; &#8220;Ask every time,&#8221; and &#8220;Not allowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Android users can delete their ad ID permanently, by opening the Settings app and navigating to Privacy &gt; Ads. Tap &#8220;Delete advertising ID,&#8221; then tap it again on the next page to confirm. According to the EFF, this will prevent any app on your phone from accessing the ad ID in the future.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69276" style="width: 660px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-69276" height="589" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/android-ads-optout.png" width="650" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69276">Image: eff.org</p></div>
<p>By default, Apple&#8217;s iOS requires apps to ask permission before they can access your device&#8217;s IDFA. When you install a new app, it may ask for permission to track you. When prompted to do so by an app, select the &#8220;Ask App Not to Track&#8221; option. Apple users also can set the &#8220;Allow apps to request to track&#8221; switch to the &#8220;off&#8221; position, which will block apps from asking to track you.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69278" style="width: 585px;"><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69278" height="390" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/applerequesttotrack.png" width="575" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69278">Apple&#8217;s Privacy and Ad Tracking Settings.</p></div>
<p>Apple also has its own targeted advertising system which is separate from third-party tracking enabled by the IDFA. To disable it, go to Settings, Privacy, and Apple Advertising, and ensure that the &#8220;Personalized Ads&#8221; setting is set to &#8220;off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, if you&#8217;re the type of reader who&#8217;s the default IT support person for a small group of family or friends (bless your heart), it would be a good idea to set their devices not to track them, and to disable any apps that may have location data sharing turned on 24/7.</p>
<p>There is a dual benefit to this altruism, which is clearly in the device owner&#8217;s best interests. Because while <em>your</em> device may not be directly trackable via advertising data, making sure they&#8217;re opted out of said tracking also can reduce the likelihood that you are trackable simply by being physically close to those who <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZbywA8qayZtyi7djUM2WX-it_cO9j_1E_iavz-5FlvKPwx5_5MlV-jIBrRSHsTgamM9rFsXjVrr0EC4ZiDS81gOY3CFXc__SltZQlqH413AYOFnguAyFQLFWaEWwzrAK_kHNjR3_A2jCWXKqB2W1VdJvWOl5rjQ4B3UGR2DgNnQt3-_EKrm10s2IxjFiI/s4857/pexels-abdullah-bin-mubarak-2067629-3693732.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="426" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZbywA8qayZtyi7djUM2WX-it_cO9j_1E_iavz-5FlvKPwx5_5MlV-jIBrRSHsTgamM9rFsXjVrr0EC4ZiDS81gOY3CFXc__SltZQlqH413AYOFnguAyFQLFWaEWwzrAK_kHNjR3_A2jCWXKqB2W1VdJvWOl5rjQ4B3UGR2DgNnQt3-_EKrm10s2IxjFiI/w640-h426/pexels-abdullah-bin-mubarak-2067629-3693732.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">Several vulnerabilities in the Safari web browser for macOS may have left users open to being spied on, having their data stolen, and acquiring other types of malware thanks to this security weakness.

Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the special permissions Apple gives to its proprietary apps, and here, it is the browser, as well as the ease with which an attacker can obtain the important configuration files of an app.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, what it allows a user to do is to circumvent the Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) security layer on MacBooks that is designed to safeguard sensitive data from an attacker. CVE-2024-44133 has been rated as a "medium" severity vulnerability by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), meaning that it has a 5.5 severity score as per the CVSS.

According to the CVE-2024-44133 vulnerability report, attackers can bypass the user data protection methods implemented by the operating system by bypassing Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC).&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the September 16 update for Mac Studio (2022 and later), iMac (2019 and later), Mac Pro (2019 and later), Mac Mini (2018 and later), MacBook Air (2020 and later), MacBook Pro (2018 and later), and iMac Pro (2017 and later), the vulnerability, also referred to as CVE-2024-44133, had been fixed.

Please take note that this vulnerability will only impact devices that are managed by Mobile Device Management (MDM), not any other device. Typically, MDM managed devices are subject to policies and procedures set by the IT department of an organization, which is responsible for centrally managing and maintaining the devices.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Microsoft, the flaw has been named "HM Surf." By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker would be able to bypass macOS' Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) features and gain unauthorized access to a user's protected data, which they would have no control over.

There is a possibility users may discover Safari's TCC in action while browsing a website that requires access to the camera or microphone when browsing through the website.

It was noted by Apple in mid-September that a bug in macOS Sequoia 15 has been fixed by removing the vulnerable code. However, the bug does not seem to affect MDM-managed devices.

As stated in the blog post, Microsoft’s Sequoia 15 release only protects Apple’s Safari web browser when it is installed.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was also pointed out that browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox don't have the same private entitlements as Apple applications, so they cannot bypass TCC checks like Apple applications can. Therefore, once TCC checks are approved, it is up to the app to maintain access to the privacy database as long as people have approved the checks.

This vulnerability can be exploited by removing the TCC protection for the Safari browser directory and editing a configuration file in that directory. It is stated in Microsoft's response that it involves gaining access to the user's data, such as browsed pages, the camera, microphone, and location of the device, without the user's knowledge.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Users of macOS are strongly encouraged to apply these security updates as soon as possible so that their system will be protected. Using its behavior monitoring capabilities, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has detected activities associated with Adload, one of the most prevalent macOS threat families, which may be exploiting this vulnerability in some way. In addition to detecting and blocking CVE-2024-44133 exploitation, Windows Defender for Endpoint also detects and blocks anomalous modifications of the Preferences file through HM Surf or other mechanisms that potentially exploit the vulnerability.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Microsoft, it was TCC technology that first enabled them to learn how to bypass the technology when they discovered powerdir's vulnerability. Please remember that TCC, as its name implies, is a technology that prevents apps from accessing users' personal information when they are installed and that this includes services such as location services, camera and microphone devices, download directories, and others, without the user's knowledge or consent.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the world of mobile applications, the only legal way for them to gain access to these services is by approving a popup through their user interface, or if they approve per-app access via the settings in their operating system. 

This vulnerability, known as HM-Surf, may allow attackers to bypass key security features on macOS systems, which gives them a chance to gain access to sensitive data through the use of malicious code. It is possible that users who are not authorized to exploit the flaw could exploit macOS' own security functions, such as the sandboxing mechanisms and restrictions on file access.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">HM-Surf exploit is a vulnerability that allows attackers to gain enhanced privileges, which allows them to access sensitive data and files that would otherwise require a login and password.

Initial warnings were raised about this vulnerability because it played a role in adware campaigns, where malicious actors used this loophole to install unwanted software on users' devices in order to profit from the vulnerability. There are, however, a lot more dangers than just adware; though, it is only the beginning. If the same vulnerability were weaponized, then it might even be used for more serious attacks, such as data exfiltration, surveillance, or even as a gateway to further malware infiltration in the near future.

There is probably no doubt that HM-Surf's unique ability to bypass Apple's robust security architecture is one of the most troubling aspects of this malware.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Security

macOS is widely regarded as a secure platform, but the recent discovery of the HM-Surf vulnerability shows that even advanced systems are not immune to evolving cyber threats. This finding serves as a crucial reminder for users and organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and adopt proactive measures to protect their digital environments.

Microsoft's cybersecurity team uncovered HM-Surf, an exploit posing a serious risk to macOS. Their investigation revealed a program altering Google Chrome settings to grant unauthorized microphone and camera access while collecting user and device data.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">These actions suggested preparations for a second-stage payload that could further compromise the device.

The culprit was identified as the well-known macOS adware "AdLoad." This malware hijacks browser traffic, inundates users with ads, harvests data, and transforms infected devices into botnet nodes for further malicious activity. Although Microsoft's findings aligned with HM-Surf techniques, the researchers could not conclusively link AdLoad to actively exploiting the vulnerability.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, they warned that "attackers using a similar method to deploy a prevalent threat" underscored the need for enhanced protection.

The HM-Surf vulnerability illustrates the risks associated with macOS, highlighting that no operating system is invulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Exploiting such weaknesses could lead to severe consequences, including financial losses, reputational damage, and the exposure of sensitive data. The evolving nature of these threats suggests that attackers are continuously refining their methods to bypass security measures.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">To address these challenges, organizations must adopt a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. This includes regular system updates, comprehensive monitoring, and user education on safe practices. Deploying advanced threat detection and real-time monitoring can help detect and mitigate attacks before they cause significant harm. Regular security assessments can also identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

In summary, the emergence of the HM-Surf vulnerability is a stark reminder of the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity threats. For macOS users and businesses, this discovery emphasizes the need to act swiftly in strengthening defenses and protecting digital assets against evolving risks.</div>

As per a report in a local media outlet, the investigation was launched following claims made by a well-known hacker identified as “IntelBroker.”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“Cisco is aware of reports that an actor is alleging to have gained access to certain Cisco-related files,” a Cisco spokesperson stated. “We have launched an investigation to assess this claim, and our investigation is ongoing.”&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The allegations surfaced after IntelBroker claimed, along with two others designated as "EnergyWeaponUser" and "zjj," that they infiltrated Cisco's servers on June 10, 2024, and obtained a large amount of developer-related data.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">IntelBroker's post on a hacking forum showed that the data would include "GitHub projects, GitLab projects, SonarQube projects, source code, hard-coded credentials, certificates, customer SRCs, Cisco confidential documents, Jira tickets, API tokens, AWS private buckets, Cisco technology SRCs, Docker builds, Azure storage buckets, private and public keys, SSL certificates, Cisco premium products, and more." The hacker uploaded samples of a database, client information, multiple files, and screenshots of customer management interfaces.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to a recent update from IntelBroker, the breach also involves the theft of sensitive data from other major global companies such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Microsoft. The stolen data is now allegedly being offered for sale on the cybercrime platform Breach Forums, with IntelBroker specifying that the transaction would take place in exchange for Monero (XMR), a cryptocurrency known for its anonymity properties.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The hacker expressed a willingness to use an intermediary to facilitate the sale, assuring anonymity for both the buyer and seller. This technique is often used by hackers to evade detection by authorities.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">IntelBroker, which is known for high-profile data thefts, has already claimed responsibility for compromising other prominent firms. In June 2024, IntelBroker reported that they had infiltrated Apple, taking source code for internal tools, as well as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), stealing employee and product information. In May 2024, IntelBroker claimed to have hacked Europol, which the organisation later confirmed.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">IntelBroker did not provide any specific details on the techniques employed to acquire the data. The stolen data originated from a third-party managed services provider that specialises in software development and DevOps, according to sources knowledgeable with the breaches who spoke with BleepingComputer. It's still unclear if the earlier June incidents and the recent Cisco hack are linked.</span></div></span>

"We're not here to safeguard e-commerce, but we do protect small and medium-sized businesses. "There are millions who must be protected," the minister stated.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">If Temu makes such a move, Jakarta will likewise block its investment in local e-commerce, according to Budi, who added that he is unaware of any such plan. Additionally, Budi stated that the government intends to ask Shein, a Chinese online retailer, for a similar ban. 

Last year, Indonesia compelled China's ByteDance social media network TikTok to shut down its online shopfront in order to safeguard the privacy of local users and merchants.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Months later, TikTok agreed to acquire a majority stake in Indonesian digital behemoth GoTo's e-commerce subsidiary in order to maintain its presence in Southeast Asia's largest e-commerce market. On Tuesday, Indonesian e-commerce company Bukalapak.com refuted news of an acquisition by Temu.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to an estimate by Google, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, and consultancy Bain &amp; Co., Indonesia's e-commerce industry could grow to almost $160 billion by 2030, up from $62 billion in 2023.</span></div></span>

The issue arose when Sevco researchers detected personal iOS apps showing up on corporate Mac devices. This triggered a deeper investigation into the problem, revealing a systemic issue affecting multiple upstream software vendors and customers. The bug creates two main concerns: employees’ personal data could be unintentionally accessed by their employers, and companies could face legal risks for collecting that data. &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Sevco highlighted that while employees may worry about their personal lives being exposed, companies also face potential data liability even if the access occurs unintentionally. This is especially true when personal iPhones are connected to company laptops or desktops, leading to private data becoming accessible.

Sean Wright, a cybersecurity expert, commented that the severity of the issue depends on the level of trust employees have in their employers. According to Wright, individuals who are uncomfortable with their employers having access to their personal data should avoid using personal devices for work-related tasks or connecting them to corporate systems.

Sevco’s report recommended several actions for companies and employees to mitigate this risk.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, employees should stop using the mirroring app to prevent the exposure of personal information. In addition, companies should advise their employees not to connect personal devices to work computers. Another key step involves ensuring that third-party vendors do not inadvertently gather sensitive data from work devices. The cybersecurity experts at Sevco urged companies to take these steps while awaiting an official patch from Apple to resolve the issue.

When Apple releases the patch, Sevco recommends that companies promptly apply it to halt the collection of private employee data.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, companies should purge any previously collected employee information that might have been gathered through this vulnerability. This would help eliminate liability risks and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

This report highlights the importance of maintaining clear boundaries between personal and work devices. With an increasing reliance on seamless technology, including mirroring apps, the risks associated with these tools also escalate.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While the convenience of moving between personal phones and work computers is appealing, privacy issues should not be overlooked. The Sevco report emphasizes the importance of being vigilant about security and privacy in the workplace, especially when using personal devices for professional tasks. Both employees and companies need to take proactive steps to safeguard personal information and reduce potential legal risks until a fix is made available.</div>

When you turn on a smart TV from LG, Samsung, or Sony, data is collected from the TV itself, as well as the operating system and apps. Then there are the gadgets you connect to your television, like Google's Chromecast, Apple TV, and Amazon's Fire Stick.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">A TV is now more than just a screen for entertainment; it's a two-way mirror that lets a network of data brokers and advertisers watch you in real time, stated Rowenna Fielding, director of data protection consultancy Miss IG Geek. “The purpose of this is to gather as much information as possible about your behaviour, interests, preferences and demographics so it can be monetised, mainly through targeted advertising.”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Your smart TV's data collection relies on the manufacturer, brand, and version. In theory, most smart TVs can gather audio, video, and TV usage data, according to Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at cybersecurity firm Darktrace.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Voice activation is a function that has the ability to collect significant volumes of data. Microphones and software listen for instructions and can record conversations and other noises within range. These recordings can be sent to third parties for analysis.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>What does your TV do with the data?</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">There is no clear answer. According to Lewis, what is done with the data is complex and "highly opaque". When looking at what a smart TV does on the network, it is often unclear why certain data is being harvested and where it is being sent.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">There isn't much distinction between television brands. Manufacturers claim to utilise your information for "personalisation" and content quality, although it is usual to sell anonymous or semi-anonymized data to third parties, advertising companies, or streaming services.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">“After the data has been sold, it is out of the manufacturer’s control,” Lewis explains. "It is often unclear what data exactly is being sent back, depending on the T&amp;Cs and privacy settings, and it can be very difficult to change default settings once you have agreed to them.”</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>What is Automatic Content Recognition (ACR)?&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Automated content recognition (ACR) is one alarming feature to keep an eye out for. This feature, which is frequently enabled by default, uses analytical techniques to detect video and audio on the TV and compares it to a large database to determine what is playing. It's fairly disturbing stuff; ACR works on anything played on television, including DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, and games.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security company ESET, explains that viewing data and habits are shared with manufacturers and eventually sold to advertisers in order to target you with adverts. When your TV is connected to your home router, data will include your IP address and position.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Lewis adds that ACR may theoretically be utilised for even more ominous profiling. "Data from facial recognition, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text, and content analysis could be gathered to build an in-depth picture of an individual user with the analytical technologies available."&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Lewis suggests that rather than comparing material to a catalogue of well-known films, ACR may theoretically be examined for factors like political stance, ethnicity, social status, and other characteristics that could be misused.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b>Safety tips&nbsp;</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Smart TVs will gather data as long as they are connected to the internet, and it is impossible to prevent this from happening. In many cases, doing so is not in your best interests because it will interfere with your viewing experience; for example, Netflix's useful suggestions tool.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, there are several simple steps you may take to protect yourself from smart TV snooping. Turn off ACR in the settings, disable customisation, opt out of all advertising features, and hide or disable cameras and microphones.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It's also vital to secure your router by changing the password and creating a guest network. You may increase security by opting out of online tracking when it's provided and installing software updates as soon as possible.</span></div></span>

Until then the most significant update is still RCS, the even more belated upgrade of stock SMS on iPhones.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">As security experts commented before, Apple’s RCS upgrade has a lot of security flaws—no end-to-end encryption is the key one, with its lack being a major step back, but there’s also patchy carrier adoption, no full iMessage integration, and no end in sight for those dreaded green bubbles.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">But Google campaigned hard for years, cajoling Apple into making this move as its own Android Messages app lost ever more ground to WhatsApp and other over-the-tops, while Apple seemingly brushed away any concerns, with its critical US user base continuing to iMessage between themselves.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">And, while Google has teased Apple over their flawed RCS implementation, it has also made it clear how welcome this is. But there was always the chance that Google and its consumers would not see the equal playing field they desired, and that risk appears to be coming true.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Android Authority recently claimed that "iPhone users are not as into RCS as their Android buddies would have liked." There are some clear barriers to better adoption, particularly carrier support. But the underlying issue is much simpler: WhatsApp. This long-awaited partial integration of iMessage and Google Messages has been so delayed that WhatsApp has effectively locked down every significant market outside of the United States (and China).&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">With Apple's iMessage security being one of its main selling points, security and privacy have grown so central to the iPhone and its user base that an update that abandons all of that appears counter-intuitive in every sense. The fact that even Google is unable to view user content due to its extensive usage of end-to-end encryption throughout its own platform—which is akin to Apple's—makes this situation worse. However, all of that disappears when using cross-platform RCS texting.,</span></div></span>

<title>Risk, reward and reality: Has enterprise perception of the public cloud changed?</title>
<link>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/risk-reward-reality-enterprise-perception-public-cloud/</link>
<guid>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/risk-reward-reality-enterprise-perception-public-cloud/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Public clouds now form the bulk of enterprise IT environments. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/817296/worldwide-enterprise-cloud-strategy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Statista data</a>, 73% of enterprises use a hybrid cloud model, 14% use multiple public clouds and 10% use a single public cloud solution. Multiple and single private clouds make up the remaining 3%.</p>
<p>With enterprises historically reticent to adopt public clouds, adoption data seems to indicate a shift in perception. Perhaps enterprise efforts have finally moved away from reducing risk to prioritizing the potential rewards of public cloud resources.</p>
<p>Reality, however, isn&rsquo;t so cut-and-dry. Here&rsquo;s a look at the current state of public perception, where enterprises still encounter cloud issues and how familiar concerns have a new focus: AI.</p>
<h2>Public perception on cloud computing</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cloud computing</a> has always had a perception problem. From the perspective of enterprise C-suites and IT teams, public clouds meant bigger <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">attack surfaces</a> combined with lower visibility, giving attackers the upper hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from the perspective of consumers &mdash; which all C-suite and IT team members become on their days off &mdash; the cloud came with massive potential. From file and photo storage to streaming video services and worldwide e-commerce, the public cloud quickly became commonplace in public life.</p>
<p>So why the disconnect? In large part, enterprises were concerned about the man behind the curtain. While many providers were long on promises, they were short on details. The result was a &ldquo;shared responsibility&rdquo; model that saw both customer and provider playing a role in data defense, but neither one was entirely clear on what that role entailed. This was exemplified by a Capital One <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data breach</a> in 2019, which saw both the bank and its cloud partner, AWS, <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/shared-responsibility-models-cloud-security-azure-aws-google/596579/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">under scrutiny for their security</a>.</p>
<p>To help address these concerns, cloud providers doubled down on security. In 2021, Amazon, Google, IBM and Apple <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/tech-giants-commit-30b-to-cybersecurity-after-white-house-meeting/2021/08/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pledged $30 billion</a> to help address growing security concerns. It worked: In 2024, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/12/latest-trends-and-predictions-for-the-future-of-cloud-hosting/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">94% of businesses</a> reported improvement in security after moving to the cloud. Or consider the results of Flexera&rsquo;s State of the Cloud Report: In <a href="https://www.flexera.com/about-us/press-center/flexera-releases-2020-state-of-the-cloud-report" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2020</a>, security was the top concern among executives. In 2024, security has fallen to second place.</p>
<p>The data tells the tale: Enterprise public cloud perception is changing.</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-53217">Strengthen your cloud defenses</a>
<h2>Ongoing cloud challenges</h2>
<p>While cloud providers have made significant strides in addressing security concerns, other issues remain.</p>
<p>For example, the top challenge in Flexera&rsquo;s 2024 State of the Cloud Report is managing cloud spend, cited by 82% of enterprises, while lack of resources and expertise comes in third with 79%.</p>
<p>When it comes to cloud spending, there&rsquo;s no easy answer. In fact, ease is sometimes the issue. As providers streamline the process of purchasing, deploying and integrating cloud-based applications and services, it&rsquo;s easy for enterprises to lose track of exactly what they have, exactly where it is and exactly how much it costs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that spending shows up twice on the Flexera report: Once in the top spot for cloud spend at large and again in fourth place as companies struggle to manage software licenses across multiple clouds and applications.</p>
<p>Lack of resources and expertise, meanwhile, remains a persistent challenge for enterprises. According to research from <a href="https://www.softwareone.com/en/blog/articles/2023/11/13/cloud-skills-gap-in-2023" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Software One</a>, 95% of businesses now face a cloud and IT skills gap. While upskilling current staff can help reduce the impact of this gap, the expansion of public cloud environments creates the longer term problem of doing more work with fewer people. While it&rsquo;s possible to task IT teams with handling the public cloud in addition to other line-of-business objectives, the results can lead back to the original concern with cloud deployments: Reduced security.</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s old is new again</h2>
<p>Even as enterprises come to terms with the necessity and ubiquity of the cloud, a new challenge has emerged: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI</a>.</p>
<p>Much like the public cloud, artificial intelligence has the potential to change the way enterprises do business. But it also opens new avenues for security compromise, leading many companies to remain cautious of AI adoption.</p>
<p>In some cases, this means limiting the scope of AI in enterprise environments. For example, organizations might leverage AI in process automation but shy away from using generative tools for content creation or sales efforts. They might deploy <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI solutions</a> to analyze disparate data but only trust humans to turn output into action.</p>
<p>The result is a perceptive landscape that is both similar and distinct from its cloud predecessor. Consider recent data from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-30-gartner-survey-shows-rising-concern-of-ai-enhanced-malicious-attacks-as" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gartner</a>, which found that the top concern cities by companies in Q2 2024 were AI-enhanced malicious attacks. This aligns with historic worries about the public cloud as a path to compromise &mdash; if attackers could access shared resources, they could potentially cause inter-departmental chaos.</p>
<p>AI, however, comes with a unique concern: Evolution. While cloud-based threats made use of expanded attack surfaces, they remained fundamentally the same as their previous-generation counterparts: If tools didn&rsquo;t work, it was back to the drawing board for malicious actors.</p>
<p>In the case of AI, meanwhile, code isn&rsquo;t static. Instead, both failure and success inform the next iteration of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ransomware</a> tools or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/malware" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Malware</a>-as-a-Service offerings. This ongoing improvement is similarly present on the protective side of AI adoption, but in both cases &mdash; attack and defense &mdash; the approach to AI is naturally different than that of the cloud.</p>
<h2>The reality of cloud security</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud-security" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="resolved">Cloud security</span></a> has evolved from nebulous assurance to core component of public offerings. The results speak for themselves: More enterprises are adopting the public cloud, more enterprises are reporting improved security and fewer companies are citing security as their to-cloud challenge.</p>
<p>AI, meanwhile, has stepped up to take on the role of top security concern. In much the same way as cloud computing, some concerns around <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ai-cybersecurity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI security</a> are overblown &mdash; as the market diversifies and standardization becomes critical, companies can expect common security issues to be effectively resolved.</p>
<p>Where AI and cloud go their separate ways, however, is in the evolution of future threats. While cloud frameworks have changed to meet new corporate needs, they remain fundamentally bound by basic infrastructure. AI has no such limits, making it harder to predict the course of its development over time.</p>
<p>The reality? Cloud perception has shifted to reward. The rise of AI, however, now underpins a renewed focus on enterprise <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a> risk.</p>

As of now, this experiment is limited to a small number of users and websites, with the checkmarks appearing next to well-known companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Apple.

The blue checkmark serves as an indicator that the website is verified by Google.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When users hover over the checkmark, a message explains, “This icon is being shown because Google’s signals suggest that this business is the business that it says it is.” However, Google clarifies that this verification does not guarantee the full reliability of the website, meaning users should still exercise caution.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This feature resembles Google’s previous initiative, the BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) system, introduced in Gmail in 2023. BIMI uses blue markers to verify the authenticity of email senders, ensuring that businesses sending emails are legitimate and own the domains and logos they use.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The goal of BIMI was to combat phishing and other malicious activities by allowing users to quickly identify verified businesses.

While the checkmark feature is currently only being tested with a select group of users and websites, it has the potential to be expanded in the future.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If widely implemented, it could help users easily identify trusted websites directly from search results, offering an extra level of safety when browsing the internet.

Although it is unclear when or if Google plans to roll out the feature to all users, a company spokesperson confirmed that the test is underway.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This new experiment could be a step towards making the internet a safer space, particularly as users grow more concerned about online threats such as phishing and scams. For now, Google is monitoring the test to assess its effectiveness before deciding on a broader launch.</div>

<title>Patch Tuesday, October 2024 Edition</title>
<link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/patch-tuesday-october-2024-edition/</link>
<guid>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/patch-tuesday-october-2024-edition/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released security updates to fix at least 117 security holes in <strong>Windows</strong> computers and other software, including two vulnerabilities that are already seeing active attacks. Also, <strong>Adobe</strong> plugged 52 security holes across a range of products, and <strong>Apple</strong> has addressed a bug in its new <strong>macOS 15</strong> &#8220;<strong>Sequoia</strong>&#8221; update that broke many cybersecurity tools.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-52647" height="515" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png" width="702" /></p>
<p>One of the zero-day flaws &#8212; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-43573" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2024-43573</a> &#8212; stems from a security weakness in <strong>MSHTML</strong>, the proprietary engine of Microsoft&#8217;s <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> web browser. If that sounds familiar it&#8217;s because this is the fourth MSHTML vulnerability found to be exploited in the wild so far in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Nikolas Cemerikic</strong>, a cybersecurity engineer at <strong>Immersive Labs</strong>, said the vulnerability allows an attacker to trick users into viewing malicious web content, which could appear legitimate thanks to the way Windows handles certain web elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once a user is deceived into interacting with this content (typically through phishing attacks), the attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulate web-based services,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cemerikic noted that while Internet Explorer is being retired on many platforms, its underlying MSHTML technology remains active and vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;This creates a risk for employees using these older systems as part of their everyday work, especially if they are accessing sensitive data or performing financial transactions online,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Probably the more serious zero-day this month is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-43572" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2024-43572</a>, a code execution bug in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Management_Console" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Management Console</a>, a component of Windows that gives system administrators a way to configure and monitor the system.</p>
<p><strong>Satnam Narang</strong>, senior staff research engineer at <strong>Tenable</strong>, observed that the patch for CVE-2024-43572 arrived a few months after researchers at <strong>Elastic Security Labs</strong> disclosed an attack technique called <a href="https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/grimresource" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GrimResource</a> that leveraged an old cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability combined with a specially crafted Microsoft Saved Console (MSC) file to gain code execution privileges.<span id="more-69126"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Although Microsoft patched a different MMC vulnerability in September (CVE-2024-38259) that was neither exploited in the wild nor publicly disclosed,&#8221; Narang said. &#8220;Since the discovery of CVE-2024-43572, Microsoft now prevents untrusted MSC files from being opened on a system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft also patched <strong>Office,</strong> <strong>Azure</strong>, <strong>.NET</strong>, <strong>OpenSSH for Windows</strong>; <strong>Power BI</strong>; <strong>Windows Hyper-V</strong>; <strong>Windows Mobile Broadband</strong>, and <strong>Visual Studio</strong>. As usual, the <strong>SANS Internet Storm Center</strong> has <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20-%20October%202024/31336" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a list of all Microsoft patches released today</a>, indexed by severity and exploitability.</p>
<p>Late last month, Apple rolled out macOS 15, an operating system update called Sequoia that broke the functionality of security tools made by a number of vendors, including CrowdStrike, SentinelOne and Microsoft. On Oct. 7, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/07/apple-fixes-bugs-in-macos-sequoia-that-broke-some-cybersecurity-tools/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apple pushed an update to Sequoia users</a> that addresses these compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Finally, Adobe has released security updates to plug a total of 52 vulnerabilities in a range of software, including <strong>Adobe Substance 3D Painter</strong>, <strong>Commerce</strong>, <strong>Dimension</strong>, <strong>Animate</strong>, <strong>Lightroom</strong>, <strong>InCopy</strong>, <strong>InDesign</strong>, <strong>Substance 3D Stager</strong>, and <strong>Adobe FrameMaker</strong>.</p>
<p>Please consider backing up important data before applying any updates. Zero-days aside, there&#8217;s generally little harm in waiting a few days to apply any pending patches, because not infrequently a security update introduces stability or compatibility issues. <strong>AskWoody.com</strong> usually has the skinny on any problematic patches.</p>
<p>And as always, if you run into any glitches after installing patches, leave a note in the comments; chances are someone else is stuck with the same issue and may have even found a solution.</p>

The scheme is part of a wider investment scam known as "pig butchering," where fraudsters lure victims into investments by posing as romantic partners or financial advisors.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Victims are manipulated into losing funds, with scammers often requesting additional fees before disappearing with the money.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Group-IB, based in Singapore, noted that the campaign targets victims globally, with reports from regions like Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The fraudulent apps, created using the UniApp Framework, are labeled under "UniShadowTrade" and have been active since mid-2023, offering promises of quick financial gains.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One app, SBI-INT, even bypassed Apple’s App Store review process, giving it an illusion of legitimacy. The app disguised itself as a tool for algebraic formulas and 3D graphics calculations but was eventually removed from the marketplace.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The app used a technique that checked if the date was before July 22, 2024, and, if so, displayed a fake screen with mathematical formulas. After being taken down, scammers began distributing it via phishing websites for Android and iOS users.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For iOS, downloading the app involved installing a .plist file, requiring users to trust an Enterprise developer profile manually. Once done, the fraudulent app became operational, asking users for their phone number, password, and an invitation code.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After registration, victims went through a six-step process involving identity verification, providing personal details, and agreeing to terms for investments. Scammers then instructed them on which financial instruments to invest in, falsely promising high returns.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When victims tried to withdraw their funds, they were asked to pay additional fees to retrieve their investments, but the funds were instead stolen.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The malware also included a configuration with details about the URL hosting the login page, hidden within the app to avoid detection. One of these URLs was hosted by a legitimate service, TermsFeed, used for generating privacy policies and cookie consent banners.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Group-IB discovered another fake app on the Google Play Store called FINANS INSIGHTS, which had fewer than 5,000 downloads. A second app, FINANS TRADER6, was also linked to the same developer. Both apps targeted countries like Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, Thailand, and Cyprus.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Users are advised to be cautious with links, avoid messages from unknown sources, verify investment platforms, and review apps and their ratings before downloading.</div>

<title>Trends: Hardware gets AI updates in 2024</title>
<link>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/trends-hardware-gets-ai-updates-2024/</link>
<guid>https://securityintelligence.com/articles/trends-hardware-gets-ai-updates-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The surge in artificial intelligence (AI) usage over the past two and a half years has dramatically changed not only software but hardware as well. As AI usage continues to evolve, PC makers have found in AI an opportunity to improve end-user devices by offering AI-specific hardware and marketing them as &ldquo;AI PCs.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Pre-AI hardware, adapted for AI</h2>
<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI</a> often depended on hardware that was not explicitly designed for AI. One example is graphics processors. Nvidia Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are crucial in AI because they handle parallel processing efficiently, which is necessary for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">machine learning</a> and deep learning. Their design enables simultaneous calculations, making them more effective than CPUs for AI model training and inference.</p>
<p>Another primary hardware type is the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Intel and other companies. An FPGA is an integrated circuit (IC) that can be reprogrammed multiple times. That flexibility makes it ideal for AI tasks. FPGAs accelerate deep learning and machine learning tasks. They provide hardware customization options that mimic the behavior of GPUs or ASICs.</p>
<p>FPGAs can be integrated with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch using tools like the Intel FPGA AI Suite and the OpenVINO toolkit.</p>
<p>FPGAs are used across the automotive, healthcare and other industries. They are useful in edge computing scenarios where AI capabilities must be deployed close to the data source for faster decision-making and reduced latency.</p>
<p>And yet another type is Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). One example is Google&rsquo;s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). TPUs are custom ASICs developed by Google to accelerate machine learning workloads. They are optimized for TensorFlow and used extensively in Google&rsquo;s data centers.</p>
<h2>How the generative AI revolution changed hardware</h2>
<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, changed the public&rsquo;s and industry&rsquo;s relationship with AI. ChatGPT quickly gained immense popularity, attracting more than one million users within five days of release. By January 2023, it had reached <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/chatgpt-and-the-race-to-secure-your-intellectual-property/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">100 million users</a>, making it the fastest-growing consumer application ever.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the runaway success of ChatGPT in the general culture changed venture funding in favor of AI startups. Big tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Meta accelerated the development and public availability of their offerings, and Silicon Valley quickly saw the emergence of companies like Anthropic and Perplexity offering <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AI tools</a>.</p>
<p>Now, PC manufacturers are investing in AI-capable PCs that emphasize hybrid AI and on-device intelligence. The integration of AI into personal computers is facilitated by the emergence of specialized AI chipsets, such as neural processing units (NPUs), which enhance PCs&rsquo; ability to perform AI tasks locally.</p>
<p>This shift is expected to impact the PC market significantly. Some 60% of PCs shipped by 2027 will be AI-capable, <a href="https://canalys.com/reports/AI-PC-market-forecasts" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according to Canalys</a>.</p>
<a class="btn orange1 large" href="https://www.ibm.com/ai-cybersecurity?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&amp;mhq=AI%20cybersecurity">Explore AI cybersecurity solutions</a>
<h2>How do AI PCs differ?</h2>
<p>AI PCs are designed to efficiently execute AI workloads using a combination of CPUs, GPUs and NPUs, allowing them to handle tasks such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">generative AI</a> models more effectively than previous PC generations. This optimization enables AI PCs to run AI applications with improved performance, power efficiency and privacy by processing data locally rather than relying on cloud-based solutions.</p>
<p>Some criticize this category as a marketing gimmick and point out that many end users use generative AI through cloud-based chatbots.</p>
<p>Today, the public thinks of AI as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">large language models (LLMs)</a> running in the cloud and used as chatbots. Over time, the power and usage of AI by end users will increasingly take place via integrated features and AI-enhanced applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2nJsKvFcps" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According to Gartner Global Chief of Research Chris Howard</a>, AI will also involve more small language models (SLMs) powering non-chatbot use cases running close to the edge rather than the cloud.</p>
<p>AI processing will increasingly happen closer to the user and closer to the edge. And this means the trend of AI-specific hardware will only grow.</p>
<h2>Microsoft AI</h2>
<p>One standout is the introduction of Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot+ PCs, a new category of Windows PCs specifically designed for AI. These PCs feature new silicon capable of performing over 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS), providing all-day battery life and access to advanced AI models. The architecture of these devices integrates a high-performance NPU alongside the CPU and GPU, enhancing their AI capabilities. This configuration allows for new experiences such as real-time AI image generation, language translation and advanced search functionalities like the &ldquo;Recall&rdquo; feature, which records and analyzes device activity to improve user interaction with AI models.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also collaborated with major OEM partners, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, to bring these AI-enhanced devices to market.</p>
<h2>Apple AI</h2>
<p>Apple has made several hardware changes to accommodate and empower AI capabilities in its devices. A significant development is the integration of Apple silicon, specifically designed to handle advanced AI processing. This includes the use of specialized neural engines in devices like the iPhone 15 Pro, which are optimized for AI tasks such as machine learning and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">natural language processing</a>. These neural engines enhance the efficiency and speed of AI operations, enabling features like real-time language translation and image recognition.</p>
<h2>Google AI</h2>
<p>Google has made several changes to its hardware to accommodate AI. One of the significant steps includes developing and integrating its own hardware to support AI models like Gemini. This indicates a shift from relying on external chips to using proprietary technology to enhance AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Google has even reorganized its internal teams to integrate AI across its products better. This reorganization has led to the creation of a new Platforms and Devices team, consolidating various Google products like Pixel, Android, Chrome and ChromeOS under a single leadership. This move aims to accelerate AI integration and improve the synergy between hardware and software.</p>
<h2>The AI hardware revolution</h2>
<p>The popular generative AI revolution began in November 2022 and resulted in big hardware changes to accommodate power-hungry AI use cases. The recent accommodation of AI in hardware is just the beginning, no doubt. We can look forward to AI-specific hardware trickling down beyond PCs and phones and into wearables, Internet of Things devices and more.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="color: black;">Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apple products, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</span></p>

Using techniques such as spear-phishing, malvertising, and brand impersonation, the group spreads over 50 malware payloads, including AMOS, Stealc, and Rhadamanthys, across different sectors like gaming, cryptocurrency, and software.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, Marko Polo’s campaigns have compromised thousands of devices globally, posing a significant threat to consumer privacy and business security, with potential financial losses in the millions. The group primarily uses spear-phishing tactics via direct messages on social media, targeting high-value individuals like cryptocurrency influencers, gamers, and software developers.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They impersonate popular brands such as Fortnite, Zoom, and RuneScape, creating fake job offers and project collaborations to deceive victims into downloading malware. In addition to these impersonations, Marko Polo even fabricates its own brand names like VDeck, Wasper, and SpectraRoom to lure unsuspecting users. The Marko Polo operation is highly versatile, capable of infecting both Windows and macOS platforms. On Windows, they use a tool called “HijackLoader” to deliver malware like Stealc, designed to extract data from browsers, and Rhadamanthys, which targets a wide array of applications and data types.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Rhadamanthys has also added advanced features, such as a cryptocurrency clipper to redirect payments to the attackers’ wallets, and the ability to evade Windows Defender.

When it comes to macOS, the group deploys Atomic (AMOS), an infostealer launched in 2023, which they rent out to cybercriminals for $1,000 per month. AMOS is highly effective at extracting sensitive data stored on macOS systems, such as Apple Keychain passwords, MetaMask seeds, WiFi credentials, credit card details, and other encrypted information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Marko Polo campaign’s widespread nature highlights the dangers of information-stealing malware, and users need to be vigilant against unsolicited links and downloads from unknown sources. One of the most effective ways to protect against such malware is to download software exclusively from official websites and ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date. This ensures the detection of malicious payloads before they can compromise your system.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Information-stealing malware campaigns are becoming increasingly common, with Marko Polo’s operation serving as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics cybercriminals employ today. These stolen credentials often enable hackers to breach corporate networks, engage in data theft, and disrupt business operations. Therefore, cybersecurity awareness and strong preventive measures are crucial for protecting against such malicious activities.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzqLc1f5y1gPrKMMmPIK-wT0eHf5Ob2OIC-oq-qNjnK2CJymYwL94846V4jqCE3kc3myv1xP7CuQOD9wETjvzEuDUMZt-nlHAmLAFwNmF3SJEeFozdP2j0IupQZTs4Wj4O5s-FpKgTTJqbHoKpKCFq0iCuUwW5Uws_wTQ2UmfrKBYayH9KTL4XPiVL6Ao/s1280/ai-generated-8533603_1280.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzqLc1f5y1gPrKMMmPIK-wT0eHf5Ob2OIC-oq-qNjnK2CJymYwL94846V4jqCE3kc3myv1xP7CuQOD9wETjvzEuDUMZt-nlHAmLAFwNmF3SJEeFozdP2j0IupQZTs4Wj4O5s-FpKgTTJqbHoKpKCFq0iCuUwW5Uws_wTQ2UmfrKBYayH9KTL4XPiVL6Ao/s600/ai-generated-8533603_1280.jpg" width="600" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When Microsoft launched Windows 11 in 2021, the new operating system came with a stringent hardware requirement: the presence of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), specifically one that meets the TPM 2.0 standard. A TPM is a secure cryptoprocessor designed to manage encryption keys and handle security-related tasks, making it a critical component for features such as Secure Boot, BitLocker, and Windows Hello.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The TPM architecture, defined by the ISO/IEC 11889 standard, was created over 20 years ago by the Trusted Computing Group. The standard outlines how cryptographic operations should be implemented, emphasizing integrity protection, isolation, and confidentiality. A TPM can be implemented as a discrete chip on a motherboard, embedded in the firmware of a PC chipset, or built directly into the CPU, as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm have done over the past decade.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Most PCs manufactured since 2016 come with a TPM 2.0, as Microsoft mandated that year that all new computers shipped with Windows must have this technology enabled by default. Even some older devices may have a TPM, though it might be disabled in the BIOS or firmware settings. Intel began incorporating TPM 2.0 into its processors in 2014, but the feature was mainly available on business-oriented models. Devices built before 2014 may have discrete TPMs that conform to the earlier TPM 1.2 standard, which is not officially supported by Windows 11.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The TPM enhances security by providing a secure environment for processing cryptographic operations and storing sensitive data, like private keys used for encryption. For example, it works with the Secure Boot feature to ensure that only signed, trusted code runs during startup. It also enables biometric authentication via Windows Hello and holds the BitLocker keys that encrypt the contents of a system disk, making unauthorized access nearly impossible.

Windows 10 and 11 initialize and take ownership of the TPM during installation, and it’s not just limited to Windows; Linux PCs and IoT devices can also use a TPM.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Apple devices employ a different design known as the Secure Enclave, which performs similar cryptographic tasks. The added level of security provided by a TPM is crucial in protecting against tampering and unauthorized data access.

For those with older PCs, upgrading to Windows 11 may require enabling TPM in the BIOS or using a utility to bypass hardware checks. However, the extra security enforced by TPM in tamper-resistant hardware is an essential advancement in protecting your data and ensuring system integrity.</div>

 According to an investigation by McAfee Labs researcher SangRyol Ryu, the malware "targets mnemonic keys by scanning for images on your device that might contain them," and it has expanded its targeting footprint to include the UK.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The campaign uses fake Android apps to deceive users into installing them. These apps seem like real banking, government, streaming, and utility apps. As many as 280 fake apps have been uncovered since the start of the year.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">It all begins with SMS messages with booby-trapped links directing users to download the apps in question in the form of APK files published on fraudulent websites. Once installed, they will request intrusive permissions to extract data from the devices.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The most prominent feature is its ability to employ optical character recognition (OCR) to steal mnemonic keys, which are recovery or seed phrases that allow users to restore access to their bitcoin wallets. Unauthorised access to the mnemonic keys could allow attackers to gain control of the victims' wallets and drain all of the funds stored in them.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to McAfee Labs, the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure had major security flaws that permitted unauthorised access to the site's root directory as well as the exposure of victim data.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The server also has an administrator panel, which serves as a one-stop shop for remotely controlling the infected devices. The appearance of an Apple iPhone running iOS 15.8.2 with the system language set to Simplified Chinese ("zh") in the panel indicates that it may also target iOS users.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">"Originally, the malware communicated with its command-and-control (C2) server via simple HTTP requests," the researchers explained. "While this method was effective, it was also relatively easy for security tools to track and block."

"In a significant tactical shift, the malware has now adopted WebSocket connections for its communications. This upgrade allows for more efficient, real-time, two-way interactions with the C2 server and helps it avoid detection by traditional HTTP-based network monitoring tools.”&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">The finding comes a little more than a month after Group-IB disclosed another Android remote access trojan (RAT) known as CraxsRAT, which has been targeting Malaysian banking users since at least February 2024 via phishing websites. It's worth noting that CraxsRAT campaigns have already been found to target Singapore by April 2023.</span></div></span>

An investigation by Microsoft has revealed that a North Korean threat actor exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the Chromium browser that has been tracked as CVE-2024-7971 to conduct a sophisticated cyber operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to the report, Citrine Sleet, the notorious group behind the attack that targets cryptography sectors in particular, is responsible for the attack.

It has been reported that CVE-2024-7971 is a type of confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that had been impacted in versions of Chrome before 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, threat actors could gain remote code execution (RCE) access to the sandboxed Chromium renderer process and conduct a remote attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There was a vulnerability that was fixed by Google on August 21, 2024, and users should ensure that they are running the most recent version of Chrome.

It is clear from this development that the nation-state adversary is trying to increase its penetration of Windows zero-day exploits in recent months, indicating that they are persistent in their efforts to acquire and introduce oodles of zero-day exploits.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Microsoft security researcher found evidence that Citrine Sleet (formerly DEV-0139 and DEV-1222) was responsible for the activity. Citrine Sleet is also known as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, Nickel Academy, and UNC4736, all of which are associated with Citrine Sleet. There is an assessment that this sub-cluster is part of the Lazarus Group (a.k.a. Diamond Sleet and Hidden Cobra) which is related to Lazarus.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Several analysts have previously credited the use of AppleJeus malware to a Lazarus subgroup called BlueNoroff (also known as APT38, Nickel Gladstone, and Stardust Chollima), indicating the fact that the threat actors share both toolsets and infrastructure from one subgroup to another.

Some cybersecurity vendors maintain track of this North Korean threat group under different names, such as AppleJeus, Labyrinth Chollima, and UNC4736, among others.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Hidden Cobra is a term used by the U.S. government to describe malicious actors sponsored by the North Korean government collectively as being influenced by the state. It is mostly targeted at financial institutions, with a special focus on cryptocurrency organizations and individuals who are closely associated with the cryptocurrency industry.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the past, it has been linked to Bureau 121 of the Reconnaissance General Bureau of North Korea, where it practices intelligence gathering.

Moreover, North Korean hackers are also known for using malicious websites that appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms to infect prospective victims with fake job applications, weaponized cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading apps designed to steal sensitive information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This is the first time UNC4736 malware has been identified in a supply chain attack, for example in March 2023 it attacked the Electron-based desktop client of video conferencing software provider 3CX. Further, they were able to breach the website of Trading Technologies, an automation company for stock market trading, to sneakily push trojanized versions of the X_TRADER software into the system.

In a March 2022 report, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) also linked AppleJeus to the compromise of Trading Technologies' website, highlighting AppleJeus as being behind the attack.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For years, the U.S. government has repeatedly issued warnings about state-sponsored cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency-related businesses and individuals with AppleJeus malware that is backed by the North Korean government. As a result of the security vulnerability CVE-2024-7971 that was discovered last week, Google patched Chrome's version 8 JavaScript engine and reported it as a type confusion vulnerability.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In a recent cybersecurity incident report, it was revealed that victims were directed to a domain controlled by the threat group Citrine Sleet, identified as voyagorclub[.]space. The exact method by which victims were lured to this domain remains undetermined, though it is suspected that social engineering tactics were employed. This is consistent with Citrine Sleet’s established modus operandi, which frequently involves manipulating individuals through social engineering to initiate attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon successful redirection to the malicious domain, attackers leveraged a zero-day remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-7971. This vulnerability is linked to a type of confusion flaw in Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Google addressed this security issue in a recent patch, highlighting that it allowed attackers to achieve RCE within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process of the victim's browser. Once inside this sandboxed environment, the attackers further escalated their access by exploiting a secondary vulnerability in the Windows kernel.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The additional vulnerability, CVE-2024-38106, was exploited to escape the browser’s sandbox environment. This kernel vulnerability, which Microsoft had patched in their latest Patch Tuesday release, allowed attackers to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on the compromised system. Following this, the attackers downloaded and activated a highly sophisticated rootkit known as FudModule. This malware, when loaded into memory, enabled direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM), providing attackers with the capability to bypass critical kernel security measures.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The FudModule rootkit is particularly concerning, as it is designed to manipulate kernel-level processes, enabling attackers to establish persistent backdoor access to the compromised system. Through DKOM, the rootkit effectively tampers with core system functions, allowing attackers to evade detection, steal sensitive information, and potentially deploy additional malicious software.

Interestingly, the FudModule rootkit has been linked to another North Korean state-sponsored group known as Diamond Sleet, which has utilized this malware since its discovery in October 2022.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This suggests a potential collaboration between Citrine Sleet and Diamond Sleet or, at the very least, shared access to malicious tools and infrastructure. Furthermore, the rootkit bears similarities to tools used by another notorious hacking group, the Lazarus Group, indicating that FudModule may be part of a broader North Korean cyber-espionage toolkit.

Citrine Sleet's attack demonstrates a highly coordinated and multi-faceted approach, beginning with social engineering techniques to lure victims to a compromised domain and culminating in the exploitation of critical vulnerabilities to gain deep control over target systems.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By leveraging both CVE-2024-7971 and CVE-2024-38106, the attackers were able to bypass multiple layers of security, from browser sandboxing to Windows kernel defences.

Microsoft has issued a series of recommendations to help organizations mitigate the risk of such attacks. They stress the importance of maintaining up-to-date software and operating systems, as timely patching is critical to closing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Microsoft advocates for the deployment of security solutions that provide unified visibility across the entire cyberattack chain. Such tools can detect and block attacker tools and post-compromise malicious activity. Lastly, strengthening the configuration of the operating environment is recommended to minimize the likelihood of successful exploitation and post-compromise activity. 

This incident underscores the evolving nature of cyber threats and highlights the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures to detect, block, and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs).</div>

This might be the case because a lot of individuals found out about the news only after reading the stories they had missed over the weekend, or because third-party sources of app store intelligence take a little longer to report changes in rankings.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">According to Appfigures, an app intelligence company, Telegram didn't rise to the No. 2 spot on the Social Networking charts on the U.S. App Store until 3 a.m. EST on Monday, suggesting that the app is just now starting to gain traction. The app had already fallen to No. 3 in Social in the U.S. as of the time of publication, so it might only be a temporary boost.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">However, the app shot to the top of the App Store's Social Networking category and rose to become the third most popular app overall in France, the country where Durov was arrested. After climbing ten spots since Friday, Telegram now stands at No. 8 in the top apps chart (which does not include games). Appfigures stated that this is the highest position it has held here since at least January 1, 2023. Apple often uses a combination of measures, including download velocity and app install count, to determine app store rankings.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Nevertheless, the cliché "any press is good press" appears to hold true, at least in terms of Telegram's exposure on the App Store. As consumers downloaded the app out of curiosity — or possibly to support the founder's views about "free speech" — it began to rise in the rankings.</span></div></span>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Citrine Sleet threat actor group was observed by Microsoft researchers exploiting the CVE-2024-7971 zero-day vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which affects versions of Chromium prior to 128.0.6613.84. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attackers achieved remote code execution (RCE) within the sandboxed Chromium renderer process. Google has since released a patch for the vulnerability, on August 21, 2024, and users are advised to update to the latest version of Chromium to mitigate the risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;Technical Analysis&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The observed attack chain involved a typical browser exploit sequence, starting with targets being directed to a Citrine Sleet-controlled exploit domain, voyagorclub[.]space, through common social engineering tactics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the users were connected, the zero-day RCE exploit for CVE-2024-7971 was deployed, allowing the attackers to download and load shellcode containing a Windows sandbox escape exploit and the FudModule rootkit into memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>FudModule is an advanced rootkit <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">malware</a> designed to target kernel access while avoiding detection. Threat actors have been seen using the FudModule data-only rootkit to gain admin-to-kernel access on Windows-based systems, enabling read/write primitive operations and conducting Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The attack chain seen in Citrine Sleet's zero-day exploit of CVE-2024-7971 closely mirrors the chain observed by Avast, which involves a variant of FudModule known as "FudModule 2.0." This variant includes malicious loaders and a late-stage remote access trojan (RAT). The research identified the previously unknown Kaolin RAT as the malware responsible for deploying the FudModule rootkit on targeted devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion and Recommendations&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>CVE-2024-7971 is the third vulnerability this year that North Korean threat actors have exploited to deploy the FudModule rootkit, following CVE-2024-21338 and CVE-2024-38193. To address zero-day exploits effectively, it is crucial not only to keep systems updated but also to use security solutions that offer comprehensive visibility across the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cyberattack</a> chain to detect and block attacker tools and malicious activities after exploitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To mitigate the risks posed by Citrine Sleet and similar threats, the following best practices are recommended:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Activate the automatic software update function on your computer, mobile device, and any other linked devices when feasible and practical. </li>

By using phishing tactics, hackers are targeting users' passwords for Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon through phishing campaigns that pose significant risks to their personal information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A new notice has appeared warning users of Google Mail, Facebook, and Amazon that there has been a new attack on password hacking that puts their personal information at risk because society has gone digital and protecting your credentials is "the name of the game." 

There is no denying the fact that these platforms are among the most popular in the world, so it is vital to have a good understanding of what threats are coming and what possibilities there are to prevent these threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Overall, cybersecurity experts predict a steady increase for the year, but they also note that the complexity of password hacks for Gmail and Facebook, as well as attempts to access Amazon accounts, has grown dramatically as well. It has been found that the complexity of password hacks for Gmail and Facebook has increased dramatically as a result of increased complexity in the attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Typically, these hacking attempts benefit from phishing attacks, brute force attacks, and social engineering attacks, all of which are designed to take advantage of overly trustful users or weaknesses within the platforms that make them vulnerable.

Several new threat analyses, including those conducted by Kaspersky Labs, reveal that password theft attacks have become increasingly common against Amazon users, Facebook users, and, most of all, Google users. 

There have been several attacks targeting these platforms, including those aimed at stealing passwords.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Kaspersky reported an increase of 40% in attempts of hackers to entice users to access malicious sites impersonating these brands in comparison to last year based on a study it conducted.

It is no surprise that malicious hackers are seeking credentials for Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon accounts to spread their malicious programming. As a matter of fact, these accounts may be exploited to reach the full heights of cybercrime by committing data theft, malware distribution, and credit card fraud all at the same time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Google account is a skeleton key that can be used to unlock an entire treasure trove of other account credentials, as well as personal information, enabling fraudsters to access a treasure trove of private information. The information contained in a user's Gmail inbox is immeasurable when compared to that contained in their inbox on the web, and the chances are that they will have one given how popular this web-based free email service is with most people these days. 

As per Kaspersky reports, hackers are mainly targeting Google, Amazon, and Facebook passwords in their effort to steal personal information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the first half of 2024, Kaspersky Security reported a 243% increase in the number of attack attempts, with the company itself preventing approximately 4 million attempts. It is estimated that Facebook users were exposed to 3.7 million phishing attempts during the same period, and Amazon users were exposed to 3 million.&nbsp;

In an interview with Kaspersky Internet Security, Olga Svistunova, who is an expert in data security at the company, warned that a criminal with access to a Gmail account may be able to access "multiple services".&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus, it is important to note that not only may business information be leaked as a result, but also the personal information of customers can also be leaked as a result.

To target these platforms, hackers are looking for account passwords, as getting access to these platforms allows them to commit fraud, distribute malware, and steal sensitive information. It is proposed that Google accounts are especially valuable since they can be used to hack into other accounts and to collect personal information that can be used in fraud attempts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to researchers at GuidePoint Research and Intelligence Team, Rui Ataide and Hermes Bojaxhi of the GuidePoint Research and Intelligence Team, there is an ongoing phishing campaign targeting more than 130 U.S. organizations, which has been detected as a new and worrying one. There have been so many misuses of the term "highly sophisticated threat actor" in recent years that it almost has lost all meaning, but the tactics and intrusion capabilities that were employed by this as-yet-unnamed attacker have led the GRIT researchers to conclude that this attacker deserves to be called such a label.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A spear-phishing attack, as with other spear-phishing campaigns, revolves around the targeting of specific employees within an organization rather than attempting to hit every single email account in an organization with a scattergun approach, as is so often the case with so-called spear-phishing campaigns.

The attack has also targeted other tech giants, including Microsoft and Apple, as well as numerous smaller companies. Additionally, DHL, Mastercard, Netflix, eBay, and HSBC are also among the companies involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cloud security provider Netskope, in a recent report, found a 2,000-fold increase in traffic to phishing pages sent through Microsoft Sway, a cloud-based application that provides users with the ability to create visual instructions, newsletters, and presentations through the use of visual illustrations.

Hackers are increasingly exploiting a technique known as “quishing,” a form of phishing that utilizes QR codes to deceive users into logging into malicious websites, thereby stealing their passwords. This method is particularly effective as QR codes can bypass email scanners designed to detect text-based threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, since QR codes are frequently scanned with mobile devices—which often lack the robust security measures found on desktops and laptops—users become more vulnerable to these types of attacks.

A new variant of QR code phishing has been recently detailed by J. Stephen Kowski, the Field Chief Technology Officer at SlashNext, in a LinkedIn article. Unlike traditional QR code phishing, which typically involves an image-based QR code redirecting users to a malicious site, this new method leverages Unicode text characters to create QR codes.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">According to Kowski, this approach presents three significant challenges for defenders: it evades image-based analysis, ensures accurate screen rendering, and creates a duality in appearance between the screen rendering and plain text, making detection more difficult.

Given these emerging threats, individuals who frequently use platforms such as Google’s Gmail, Facebook, and Amazon, as well as other major online services, should exercise caution to avoid becoming victims of identity theft. The risk of falling prey to password-hacking attempts can be significantly reduced by adhering to best practices in security hygiene across different accounts and maintaining a high level of vigilance.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In today’s technology-driven world, personal awareness and proactive measures serve as the first line of defence against such cyber threats.

Recognize Phishing Indicators</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">- Generic Domain Extensions: Be cautious of emails from generic domains like "@gmail.com" instead of corporate domains, as attackers use these to impersonate businesses.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Misspelt Domains: </b>Watch for near-identical domains that slightly alter legitimate ones, such as "Faceb0ok.com." These deceptive domains are used to trick users into providing sensitive information.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Content Quality:</b> Legitimate communications are typically polished and professional. Spelling errors, poor grammar, and unprofessional formatting are red flags of phishing attempts.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Urgency and Fear Tactics:</b> Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency, pressuring recipients to act quickly to avoid negative consequences, such as account suspensions or security breaches.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Unusual Requests:</b> Be wary of unexpected requests for money, personal information, or prompts to click links or download attachments. Hackers often impersonate trusted entities to deceive recipients.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Implement Security Software&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">-<b> Install robust security tools,</b> including firewalls, spam filters, and antivirus software, to guard against phishing attacks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">- <b>Utilize web filters</b> to restrict access to malicious websites.

   - Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities and protect against new threats.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- Enhance account security</b> by implementing MFA, which requires a second verification factor (e.g., a code, fingerprint, or secret question) in addition to a password.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>- MFA significantly</b> reduces the risk of unauthorized access and helps safeguard business credentials.

By staying vigilant, maintaining updated security software, and utilizing MFA, businesses can better protect their accounts and sensitive information from phishing attacks.</div>

This campaign has sparked a heated debate between two tech giants, Apple and Google, over the best way to protect user privacy online.<p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Apple’s Stance on Privacy</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Apple has long positioned itself as a champion of user <a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/google-assures-privacy-with-gemini-ai.html" target="_blank">privacy</a>. In its latest campaign, Apple highlights the extensive use of tracking cookies by Google Chrome. These cookies, Apple claims, follow users across the web, collecting data on their browsing habits. Apple argues that Chrome’s Incognito mode, which many users rely on for private browsing, isn’t truly private. According to Apple, Incognito mode still allows websites to track user activity, albeit to a lesser extent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To counter these privacy concerns, Apple promotes its own browser, Safari, as a more secure alternative. Safari, Apple claims, uses Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) to limit the ability of advertisers to track users across websites. This feature, combined with other privacy-focused tools, makes Safari a more attractive option for users who prioritize their online privacy.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Google’s Response</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.cysecurity.news/2024/08/google-assures-privacy-with-gemini-ai.html" target="_blank">Google</a>, on the other hand, has defended Chrome’s privacy practices. In response to Apple’s campaign, Google emphasized that Chrome is designed to keep user data safe and give users control over their privacy settings. Google points out that Chrome offers a range of privacy features, including the ability to block third-party cookies and manage site permissions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google also highlights its commitment to transparency. The company regularly updates its privacy policies and provides users with clear information about how their data is collected and used. Google argues that this transparency, combined with robust privacy controls, makes Chrome a trustworthy choice for users.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Broader Context</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">This clash between Apple and Google is part of a larger conversation about online privacy. As more of our lives move online, the amount of data we generate has skyrocketed. This data is incredibly valuable to advertisers, who use it to target ads more effectively. However, this data collection has raised significant privacy concerns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many users are unaware of the extent to which their online activities are tracked. Even when using private browsing modes, such as Chrome’s Incognito mode, users may still be tracked by websites and advertisers. This has led to calls for greater transparency and stronger privacy protections.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the Right Browser</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">So, what does this mean for the average user? When choosing a browser, it’s important to consider your privacy needs. If you prioritize privacy and want to limit tracking as much as possible, Safari may be the better choice. Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention and other privacy features can help protect your data from advertisers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, if you value customization and control over your browsing experience, Chrome offers a range of privacy tools that can be tailored to your needs. Google’s transparency about its data collection practices also provides users with a clear understanding of how their data is used.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ultimately, the choice between Safari and Chrome comes down to personal preference. Both browsers have their strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will depend on your individual privacy needs and browsing habits.</p>

It underscores how threat actors are increasingly targeting the OS as a target.

As of late 2023, malware dubbed Cthulhu Stealer was available as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) product and was priced at $500 per month as part of a subscription-based price structure.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As far as the architecture is concerned, it can support both x86_64 and Arm platforms. 

Several cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new form of macOS malware that can steal user's sensitive data in the most insidious ways. A malware called Cthulhu Stealer has been spotted that impersonates popular applications to infect users with Trojan malware that allows the malware to steal passwords for users' operating systems and the iCloud keychain, as well as cryptocurrency wallets.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A $500/month service offering for bad actors has reportedly been available since late 2023, as part of the Cthulhu Stealer program. It is particularly effective because it can masquerade as legitimate software and thus make itself appear more appealing.

A Cado Security researcher has pointed out that Cthulhu Stealer is an Apple disk image (DMG) that carries two binaries, depending on the architecture of the machine, according to Gould.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Using Golang, the malware disguises itself as a legitimate piece of software and disguises itself as a malicious application.

A few of the software programs it impersonates include CleanMyMac, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Adobe GenP because the last of these is an open-source tool that can patch Adobe apps to bypass Creative Cloud service encryption and use the serial key to activate them without having to create a login account with a creator's account.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A user who launches an unsigned file that has been explicitly allowed to be run – i.e., bypassing Gatekeeper protections – will be prompted to enter their system password when they launch it. In addition to Atomic Stealer, Cuckoo, MacStealer, and Banshee Stealer using this postscript-based approach, other software developers have adopted similar approaches.

Afterwards, a second prompt will appear asking the user to enter their MetaMask password for the third time.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This tool was also designed with the goal of harvesting system information and dumping iCloud Keychain passwords using an open-source tool called Chain Breaker which an anonymous developer developed.

There are several ways the data theft takes place, including through the use of web browser cookies and information from Telegram accounts. This information is compressed and stored in a ZIP file, before being sent to a command-and-control server (C2).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is believed that the main purpose of Cthulhu Stealer is to steal credentials and cryptocurrency wallets from a wide range of shops and services, including game accounts, to steal information.

The functionality and features of Cthulhu Stealer are very similar to that of Atomic Stealer, which implies that it was probably developed by the same person who modified Atomic Stealer. As users can see from the above paragraph, Atomic Stealer and Cthulhu both use Osascript as a password prompt. Even the spelling mistakes in the two games are identical.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a result, the threat actors responsible for the malware appear to have vanished, in part due to disagreements over payments, which has led to affiliates accusing the main developer of an exit scam, which has led to him being permanently banned from the cybercrime marketplace he used to advertise the malware in the first place.

It is important to note that Cthulhu Stealer does not have very sophisticated anti-analysis techniques that would allow it to operate stealthily, which could be used to avoid detection.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As well as this, it does not include any features that set it apart from similar underground offerings, apart from the fortress is one issue that affects this.

Malware like Cthulhu Stealer, as well as other software threats like it, can cause far less damage when users take macOS' security features seriously, so they do not fall victim to them.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">MacOS is much less commonly targeted by malware threats than Windows or Linux, but users are advised to stay away from downloading software from sources they don't trust, stay away from installing apps that are not verified, and make sure their systems are updated with the latest security measures.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There has been a surge in macOS malware recently and in response Apple announced this week that an update is coming to its next version of the operating system that will add more friction when trying to open software that is not signed correctly or notarized, which will help prevent future outbreaks of macOS malware.</div>

One such tool is the CAPTCHA solver developed by Greasy Opal, a name that has become synonymous with cybercrime over the past 16 years. This blog delves into the history, impact, and ongoing relevance of Greasy Opal’s CAPTCHA solver in the cybercriminal ecosystem.<p></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Genesis of Greasy Opal’s CAPTCHA Solver</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">CAPTCHAs, or Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart, were introduced as a security measure to prevent automated bots from accessing websites and online services. However, as with any security measure, some sought to circumvent it. Enter Greasy Opal, a developer who saw an opportunity in the burgeoning field of CAPTCHA-solving technology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Greasy Opal’s tool, which started as a simple script, quickly evolved into a sophisticated piece of software capable of solving CAPTCHAs with high accuracy. The tool’s effectiveness made it a favorite among cybercriminals, who used it to automate various illicit activities, from spamming and social media promotion to black hat SEO and account takeovers.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Mechanics of CAPTCHA Solving</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">At its core, a CAPTCHA solver mimics human behavior to bypass the security checks designed to differentiate between humans and bots. Greasy Opal’s solver employs advanced machine learning algorithms and image recognition techniques to decode the distorted text and images commonly used in CAPTCHAs. The tool’s ability to solve CAPTCHAs at scale has made it an invaluable asset for cybercriminals looking to automate their operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The solver is available in free and paid versions, offering higher accuracy and faster recognition times. This tiered approach has allowed Greasy Opal to monetize the tool while maintaining a veneer of legitimacy by paying taxes and operating as a seemingly lawful business.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Impact on Cybercrime</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The widespread use of Greasy Opal’s CAPTCHA solver has had a profound impact on the cybercriminal landscape. By automating the process of solving CAPTCHAs, the tool has lowered the barrier to entry for less-skilled threat actors, enabling them to carry out large-scale attacks with minimal effort. This democratization of cybercrime has led to an increase in the volume and sophistication of attacks targeting various sectors, including e-commerce, social media, and government services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Prominent entities such as Amazon, Apple, and Facebook have been targeted using Greasy Opal’s tool, highlighting the far-reaching implications of this technology. Researchers at Arkose Labs have acknowledged the tool’s efficiency, noting its role in facilitating a wide range of cybercriminal activities.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ethical and Legal Considerations</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite its clear association with illegal activities, Greasy Opal continues to operate under a legitimate guise. The developer’s decision to pay taxes and comply with certain legal requirements has allowed them to avoid significant legal repercussions. However, this raises important ethical questions about the responsibility of developers in the cybersecurity space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The case of Greasy Opal underscores the need for stricter regulations and enforcement mechanisms to curb the misuse of technology for criminal purposes. It also highlights the importance of ongoing research and innovation in developing more robust security measures to counteract such threats.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Future of CAPTCHA Solving</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">As cybersecurity measures continue to evolve, so too will the techniques used to bypass them. Greasy Opal’s CAPTCHA solver is a testament to the enduring cat-and-mouse game between security professionals and cybercriminals. While CAPTCHAs remain a widely used security measure, their effectiveness is increasingly being called into question as tools like Greasy Opal’s become more advanced.</p>

When things don’t go right, we expect CA Owners to commit to meaningful and demonstrable change resulting in evidenced continuous improvement.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past several years, publicly disclosed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?o2=greaterthaneq&amp;short_desc_type=casesubstring&amp;o1=notequals&amp;v1=Graveyard&amp;classification=Client%20Software&amp;classification=Developer%20Infrastructure&amp;classification=Components&amp;classification=Server%20Software&amp;classification=Other&amp;classification=Graveyard&amp;v2=2015-11-01&amp;f1=classification&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED&amp;short_desc=Entrust&amp;f2=creation_ts&amp;component=CA%20Certificate%20Compliance&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;list_id=17064895">incident reports</a> highlighted a pattern of concerning behaviors by Entrust that fall short of the above expectations, and has eroded confidence in their competence, reliability, and integrity as a publicly-trusted CA Owner. 
</p>
<p>
In response to the above concerns and to preserve the integrity of the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/how-chrome-root-program-keeps-users-safe.html#:~:text=Chrome%20uses%20digital,the%20%E2%80%9CWeb%20PKI.%E2%80%9D">Web PKI</a> ecosystem, Chrome will take the following actions.

<p>
Additionally, should a Chrome user or enterprise <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#Does-the-Chrome-Certificate-Verifier-consider-local-trust-decisions">explicitly trust</a> any of the above certificates on a platform and version of Chrome <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#when-did-these-features-land">relying</a> on the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a> (e.g., explicit trust is conveyed through a Group Policy Object on Windows), the SCT-based constraints described above will be overridden and certificates will function as they do today.  
</p>
<p>
To further minimize risk of disruption, website operators are encouraged to review the “Frequently Asked Questions" listed below.
</p>
<h3><strong>Why is Chrome taking action?</strong></h3>


<p>
Certification Authorities (CAs) serve a privileged and trusted role on the Internet that underpin encrypted connections between browsers and websites. With this tremendous responsibility comes an expectation of adhering to reasonable and consensus-driven security and compliance expectations, including those defined by the CA/Browser TLS Baseline Requirements.  
</p>
<p>
Over the past six years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports. When these factors are considered in aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the Internet ecosystem, it is our opinion that Chrome’s continued trust in Entrust is no longer justified. 
</p>
<h3><strong>When will this action happen?</strong></h3>


<p>
Blocking action will begin on approximately November 1, 2024, affecting certificates issued at that point or later.
</p>
<p>
Blocking action will occur in Versions of <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule">Chrome 127</a> and greater on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Android, and Linux. Apple policies prevent the Chrome Certificate Verifier and corresponding Chrome Root Store from being used on Chrome for iOS.
</p>
<h3><strong>What is the user impact of this action?</strong></h3>


<p>
By default, Chrome users in the above populations who navigate to a website serving a certificate issued by Entrust or AffirmTrust after October 31, 2024 will see a full page interstitial <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/">similar to this one</a>.
</p>
<p>
Certificates issued by other CAs are not impacted by this action.
</p>
<h3><strong>How can a website operator tell if their website is affected?</strong></h3>


<p>
Website operators can determine if they are affected by this issue by using the Chrome Certificate Viewer.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use the Chrome Certificate Viewer</span>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Navigate to a website (e.g., <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>)

</li><li>Click the “Tune" icon

</li><li>Click “Connection is Secure" 

</li><li>Click “Certificate is Valid" (the Chrome Certificate Viewer will open) 
<ul>
 
<li><strong>Website owner action is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not</span> contain “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
 
</li><li><strong>Website owner action is required</strong>, if the “Organization (O)” field listed beneath the “Issued By" heading contains “Entrust" or “AffirmTrust”.
</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
</ul>
<h3><strong>What does an affected website operator do?</strong></h3>


<p>
We recommend that affected website operators transition to a new publicly-trusted CA Owner as soon as reasonably possible. To avoid adverse website user impact, action <strong>must</strong> be completed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the existing certificate(s) expire if expiry is planned to take place <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> October 31, 2024. 
</p>
<p>
While website operators could delay the impact of blocking action by choosing to collect and install a new TLS certificate issued from Entrust before Chrome’s blocking action begins on November 1, 2024, website operators will inevitably need to collect and install a new TLS certificate from one of the many other CAs included in the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a>.
</p>
<h3><strong>Can I test these changes before they take effect?</strong></h3>


<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p>
A command-line flag was added beginning in Chrome 128 (available in Canary/Dev at the time of this post’s publication) that allows administrators and power users to simulate the effect of an SCTNotAfter distrust constraint as described in this blog post FAQ.
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to: Simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust</span></p><p>1. Close all open versions of Chrome</p><p>2. Start Chrome using the following command-line flag, substituting variables described below with actual values</p>

<div class="code">
--test-crs-constraints=$[Comma Separated List of Trust Anchor Certificate SHA256 Hashes]:sctnotafter=$[epoch_timestamp]
</div><p>

</p><p>3. Evaluate the effects of the flag with test websites&nbsp;</p><p><b>Example:</b>&nbsp;The following command will simulate an SCTNotAfter distrust with an effective date of April 30, 2024 11:59:59 PM GMT for all of the Entrust trust anchors included in the Chrome Root Store. The expected behavior is that any website whose certificate is issued before the enforcement date/timestamp will function in Chrome, and all issued after will display an interstitial.</p><p>

</p><h3><strong>I use Entrust certificates for my internal enterprise network, do I need to do anything?</strong></h3><p>
Beginning in Chrome 127, enterprises can override Chrome Root Store constraints like those described for Entrust in this blog post by installing the corresponding root CA certificate as a <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/faq.md#Does-the-Chrome-Certificate-Verifier-consider-local-trust-decisions">locally-trusted root</a> on the platform Chrome is running (e.g., installed in the Microsoft Certificate Store as a Trusted Root CA).
</p><h3><strong>How do enterprises add a CA as locally-trusted?</strong></h3><p>
Customer organizations should defer to platform provider guidance. 
</p><h3><strong>What about other Google products?</strong></h3><p>
Other Google product team updates may be made available in the future.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p>
Google and Apple have worked together to create an industry specification – <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/">Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers</a> – for Bluetooth tracking devices that makes it possible to alert users across both Android and iOS if such a device is unknowingly being used to track them. This will help mitigate the misuse of devices designed to help keep track of belongings. Google is now launching this capability on Android 6.0+ devices, and today Apple is implementing this capability in iOS 17.5.<br />
</p>
<p>
With this new capability, Android users will now get a “Tracker traveling with you” alert on their device if an unknown Bluetooth tracking device is seen moving with them over time, regardless of the platform the device is paired with. 
</p>
<p>
If a user gets such an alert on their Android device, it means that someone else’s AirTag, Find My Device network-compatible tracker tag, or other industry specification-compatible Bluetooth tracker is moving with them. Android users can view the tracker’s identifier, have the tracker play a sound to help locate it, and access instructions to disable it. Bluetooth tag manufacturers including Chipolo, eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee have committed that future tags will be compatible.
</p>
<p>
Google’s Find My Device is secure by default and private by design. <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/find-my-device-network-security-privacy-protections.html">Multi-layered user protections</a>, including first of its kind safety-first protections, help mitigate potential risks to user privacy and safety while allowing users to effectively locate and recover lost devices. This cross-platform collaboration — an industry first, involving community and industry input — offers instructions and best practices for manufacturers, should they choose to build unwanted tracking alert capabilities into their products. Google and Apple will continue to work with the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> via the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers working group to develop the official standard for this technology.

<title>Announcing Pwn2Own Ireland – Bringing Pwn2Own (and WhatsApp) to the Emerald Isle</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/7/16/announcing-pwn2own-ireland-2024</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/7/16/announcing-pwn2own-ireland-2024</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class=""><em>If you just want to read the rules, you can find them </em><a href="https://zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnIreland2024Rules.html" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Over the last few years, our consumer-focused Pwn2Own event took place in the Trend Micro office in Toronto. However, that office closed, so we needed to find a new home. This isn’t unusual for this event, as it moved from Amsterdam to Tokyo to Austin to Toronto. We’re moving again. This year, we are heading to our offices in Cork, Ireland! We’re excited about our new location, and I personally have <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/IimtaPyt7uE?feature=share" target="_blank">viewed</a> several locations for after-hours and special events. Some of those will be secret until the competition, but I can tell you that our awards ceremony and end-of-contest party will be held at the historic <a href="https://corkcitygaol.com/" target="_blank">Cork City Goal</a>. It promises to be a fun and spooky event, and we’ll have more details about that in the future.</p><p class="">Beyond our new location, we’re excited to announce <strong>Meta</strong> has joined as a sponsor of this event and will participate in the new Messenger App category. That’s right – <strong>WhatsApp</strong> will be a target, with both 0-click and 1-click exploits being in scope. We’re offering $300,000 USD for a 0-click, so we hope to see some great research on an application used by millions. We’re also excited to announce the return of <strong>Synology</strong> as a co-sponsor of the event and <strong>QNAP</strong> joins them as a co-sponsor. </p><p class="">The Messenger App category isn’t the only exciting thing heading to Ireland. This will be our first competition to feature AI-enabled devices. Both the Samsung and Google phones include <a href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/smartphones/galaxy-s24/?cid=ca_pd_ppc_google_f1h24-galaxy-s24-series_launch_im-hhp-retention_text_rtb_20180102-w-samsung%20galaxy%20s24&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7sPGn7WshwMViG8PAh1PfQdiEAAYASAAEgJoF_D_BwE#:~:text=Buy%20now-,Galaxy%20AI%20is%20here,-Welcome%20to%20the">Galaxy AI</a> and <a href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/categories/ai/">Google AI</a> respectively. Multiple Synology devices use AI for tasks such as people and vehicle recognition on the cameras and AI-driven photo albums on their NAS devices. The Ubiquiti camera also uses AI for greater detection precision and range. There’s no special bonus for exploiting an AI feature, but it will be interesting to see if AI helps or hurts exploit attempts.</p><p class="">Last year’s favorite category was the “SOHO Smashup”, and it returns for another year. This category challenges contestants by having them start by exploiting the external interface of a router, compromise the router, and then pivot to another device connected to the network. In the Toronto event last year, several teams had winning entries in this category. It’s always amazing to watch the researchers as they pivot through multiple attack surfaces to hit their final goal. We’re also bringing wired and wireless cameras back into the contest under the surveillance category. Last year, we awarded $1,038,500 during the event for 58 unique 0-days. It will be interesting to see if the luck of the Irish will take that number up or down.</p><p class="">As for the contest itself, it will run from October 22-25, 2024. As always, we’ll have a random drawing to determine the schedule of attempts on the first day of the contest, and we will proceed from there. Registration closes at 5:00 p.m. Irish Standard Time on Oct 17th, 2024. There are no exceptions for late entries, so if you have questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:pwn2own@trendmicro.com">pwn2own@trendmicro.com</a> (note the new address). We will be happy to address your issues or concerns directly.</p><p class="">Now on to the specific target categories.

<p>Let’s take a look at each category in more detail, starting with mobile phones.</p>
<p><a name="phones"></a></p>
<p><b>The Target Phones</b></p>




  <p class="">Back in Amsterdam where this contest originated, it was originally dubbed “Mobile Pwn2Own” and our focus was strictly on phones. Mobile handsets remain at the heart of this event, and some of the Samsung entries from last year were absolutely smashing. As always, these phones will be running the latest version of their respective operating systems with all available updates installed. You may notice there are no Xiaomi devices in this year’s event. That’s because, during the contest last year, they took measures to ensure attempts would fail. They didn’t seem to mind that those measures impacted all of their users globally. While we do encourage shenanigans, that’s a bit too far to be considered fair. Thus, they are not returning. If you want more details about what happened, be sure to check out Ken Gannon and Ilyes Beghdadi’s upcoming <a href="https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-speakers.html#54454" target="_blank">DEFCON talk</a> about the subject.</p><p class="">In this category, contestants must compromise the device by browsing to content in the default browser for the target under test or by communicating with the following short-distance protocols: near field communication (NFC), Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. The awards for this category are:</p>

  <p class="">The Google and Apple devices in this category also include an add-on bonus. If your exploit payload executes with kernel-level privileges, you earn an additional <strong>$50,000</strong> and 5 more Master of Pwn points. That means a full exploit chain that includes kernel-level access on the iPhone or Pixel will earn <strong>$300,000 </strong>and 30 Master of Pwn points.</p>





















  
  



<p><a name="whatsapp"></a>
<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a></p>
<p><b>Messenger Apps</b></p>




  <p class="">Almost everyone uses some messenger app in their daily lives, and these apps have been the target of sophisticated threats in the past. We’re excited that Meta has agreed to sponsor this event and are hopeful that one (or more) of our contestants will demonstrate a WhatsApp exploit. Both 0-click and 1-click exploits are in scope. All valid submissions must use vulnerabilities reachable via WhatsApp and must not depend on other applications. All WhatsApp entries will be run on a Google Pixel 8.</p>

<p><a name="soho"></a>
<a href="#top"><i>Back to top</i></a></p>
<p><b>The SOHO Smashup</b></p>




  <p class="">The proliferation of WFH resulted in many enterprises finding their network perimeter relocated to the home office. Threat actors exploiting home routers and consumer devices can use these as a launch point for lateral movements into enterprise resources. We wanted to demonstrate this during the contest, which means the SOHO Smashup category continues to be relevant. Contestants will need to first compromise the WAN port on a selected router. Once they accomplish that not-so-insignificant feat, they will need to pivot to one of the other devices and compromise it as well. The contestant is free to select any combination of router and home automation hub, smart speaker, printer, or network-attached storage device during the registration process – although you won’t have some of the same easy targets as last year. If they get both devices within 30 minutes, they earn $100,000 and 10 Master of Pwn points. </p>

<p><b>Surveillance Systems</b></p>




  <p class="">Last year, we introduced this category not knowing what to expect. As usual, our contestants did not disappoint as they unleashed some fantastic exploits – including taking over a camera just by showing it a QR code. Cameras continue to be a part of daily life, and we can’t wait to see what research is put on display this year. An attempt in this category must be launched against the target’s exposed network services or the target’s exposed features from the contestant’s laptop within the contest network.</p>

<p><b>Home Automation Hubs</b></p>




  <p class="">Many of the cameras and other “smart” devices are connected to a centralized hub. From lights to locks to thermostats, cameras, and more, all can be accessed through a home automation hub. Of course, that means a threat actor could potentially access them as well. This year, we’re introducing the AeoTec Smart Home Hub in this category, so we’ll see if our contestants take a run at it. Here are the targets in the Home Automation category:</p>

<p><b>Rage Against the Printers </b></p>




  <p class="">Printers have long been the source of jokes and memes, but they are also an often overlooked attack surface in your office. The printer category always produces some interesting results, often by playing music it shouldn’t or the occasional Rick Roll. It will be interesting to see what exploits the contestants come up with this year.</p>

  <p class=""><strong>Master of Pwn</strong></p><p class="">No Pwn2Own contest would be complete without crowning a Master of Pwn, which signifies the overall winner of the competition. Earning the title results in a slick <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eyexso3WUAYbXPK?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096">trophy</a>, a different sort of <a href="https://twitter.com/thezdi/status/1240400682034909187">wearable</a>, and brings with it an additional 65,000 ZDI reward points (instant <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/about/benefits/">Platinum</a> status in 2025).</p><p class="">For those not familiar with how it works, points are accumulated for each successful attempt. While only the first demonstration in a category wins the full cash award, each successful entry claims the full number of Master of Pwn points. Since the order of attempts is determined by a random draw, those who receive later slots can still claim the Master of Pwn title – even if they earn a lower cash payout. As with previous contests, there are penalties for withdrawing from an attempt once you register for it. If the contestant decides to remove an Add-on Bonus during their attempt, the Master of Pwn points for that Add-on Bonus will be deducted from the final point total for that attempt. For example, someone registers for the Apple iPhone 15 with the Kernel Bonus Add-on. During the attempt, the contestant drops the Kernel Bonus Add-on but completes the attempt. The final point total will be 20 Master of Pwn points.</p><p class=""><strong>The Complete Details</strong></p><p class="">The full set of rules for Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 can be found <a href="https://zerodayinitiative.com/Pwn2OwnIreland2024Rules.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

<title>The May 2024 Security Update Review</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/5/14/the-may-2024-security-update-review</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/5/14/the-may-2024-security-update-review</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="">Welcome to the second Tuesday of May. As expected, Adobe and Microsoft have released their standard bunch of security patches. Take a break from your regular activities and join us as we review the details of their latest advisories. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>





















  
  






  <p class=""><strong>Apple Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">Apple kicked off the May release cycle with a group of updates for their macOS and iOS platforms. Most notable is a fix for CVE-2024-23296 for <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214100" target="_blank">iOS 16.7.8 and iPadOS 16.7.8</a>. This vulnerability is a memory corruption issue in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXMawXNtXrQ">RTKit</a> that could allow attackers to bypass kernel memory protections. The initial patch was released back in March, but Apple noted additional fixes would be coming, and here they are. This bug is reported as being under active attack, so if you’re using a device with an affected OS, make sure you get the update.</p><p class="">Apple also patched the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214103" target="_blank">Safari</a> bug demonstrated at Pwn2Own Vancouver by Master of Pwn Winner Manfred Paul.</p><p class=""><strong>Adobe Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">For May, Adobe released eight patches addressing 37 CVEs in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, Illustrator, Substance3D Painter, Adobe Aero, Substance3D Designer, Adobe Animate, FrameMaker, and Dreamweaver. Eight of these vulnerabilities were reported through the ZDI program. The update for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb24-29.html" target="_blank">Reader</a> should be the priority. It includes multiple Critical-rated bugs that are often used by malware and ransomware gangs. While none of these bugs are under active attack, it is likely some will eventually be exploited. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb24-30.html">Illustrator</a> also addresses a couple of Critical-rated bugs that could result in arbitrary code execution. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/aero/apsb24-33.html" target="_blank">Aero</a> (an augmented reality authoring and publishing tool) fixes a single code execution bug. Unless I’m mistaken, this is the first Adobe patch for this product.</p><p class="">The fix for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/animate/apsb24-36.html" target="_blank">Adobe Animate</a> fixes eight bugs, seven of which result in Critical-rated code execution. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/framemaker/apsb24-37.html">FrameMaker</a> also fixes several code execution bugs. These are classic open-and-own bugs that require user interaction. That’s the same for the single bug fixed in <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/dreamweaver/apsb24-39.html">Dreamweaver</a>. The patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/substance3d_painter/apsb24-31.html">Substance 3D Painter</a> addresses four bugs, two of which are rated Critical, while the patch for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/substance3d_designer/apsb24-35.html">Substance 3D Designer</a> fixes a single Important-rated memory leak.</p><p class="">None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3.</p><p class=""><strong>Microsoft Patches for May 2024</strong></p><p class="">This month, Microsoft released 59 CVEs in Windows and Windows Components; Office and Office Components; .NET Framework and Visual Studio; Microsoft Dynamics 365; Power BI; DHCP Server; Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based); and Windows Mobile Broadband. If you include the third-party CVEs being documented this month, the CVE count comes to 63. A total of two of these bugs came through the ZDI program. As with last month, none of the bugs disclosed at Pwn2Own Vancouver are fixed with this release. With Apple and <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24280">VMware</a> fixing the vulnerabilities reported during the event, Microsoft stands alone as the only vendor not to produce patches from the contest.</p><p class="">Of the new patches released today, only one is rated Critical, 57 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. This release is roughly a third of the size of last month’s, so hopefully that’s a sign that a huge number of fixes in a single month isn’t going to be a regular occurrence.</p><p class="">Two of the CVEs released today are listed as under active attack, and one other is listed as publicly known at the time of the release. Microsoft doesn’t provide any indication of the volume of attacks, but the DWM Core bug appears to me to be more than a targeted attack. Let’s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with the DWM bug currently exploited in the wild:</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30051" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30051</strong></a><strong> – Windows DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br /></strong>This bug allows attackers to escalate the SYSTEM on affected systems. These types of bugs are usually combined with a code execution bug to take over a target and are often used by ransomware. Microsoft credits four different groups for reporting the bug, which indicates the attacks are widespread. They also indicate the vulnerability is publicly known. Don’t wait to test and deploy this update as exploits are likely to increase now that a patch is available to reverse engineer.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30043" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30043</strong></a><strong> – Microsoft SharePoint Server Information Disclosure Vulnerability<br /></strong>This vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by ZDI researcher Piotr Bazydło and represents an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019. An authenticated attacker could use this bug to read local files with SharePoint Farm service account user privileges. They could also perform an HTTP-based server-side request forgery (SSRF), and – most importantly – perform NLTM relaying as the SharePoint Farm service account. Bugs like this show why info disclosure vulnerabilities shouldn’t be ignored or deprioritized.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30033" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30033</strong></a><strong> – Windows Search Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is another bug reported through the ZDI program and has a similar impact to the bug currently being exploited, although it manifests through a different mechanism. This is a link following bug in the Windows Search service. By creating a pseudo-symlink, an attacker could redirect a delete call to delete a different file or folder as SYSTEM. We discussed how this could be used to elevate privileges <a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/3/16/abusing-arbitrary-file-deletes-to-escalate-privilege-and-other-great-tricks" target="_blank">here</a>. The delete happens when restarting the service. A low-privileged user can't restart the service directly. However, this could easily be combined with a bug that allows a low-privileged user to terminate any process by PID. After failure, the service will restart automatically, successfully triggering this vulnerability.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-30050" target="_blank"><strong>CVE-2024-30050</strong></a><strong> – Windows Mark of the Web Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability<br /></strong>We don’t normally detail Moderate-rated bugs, but this type of security feature bypass is quite in vogue with ransomware gangs right now. They zip their payload to bypass network and host-based defenses, they use a Mark of the Web (MotW) bypass to evade SmartScreen or Protected View in Microsoft Office. While we have no indication this bug is being actively used, we see the technique used often enough to call it out. Bugs like this one show why Moderate-rated bugs shouldn’t be ignored or deprioritized.</p><p class="">Here’s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for May 2024:</p>

  <p class=""><em>* Indicates this CVE had been released by a third party and is now being included in Microsoft releases</em>.</p><p class=""><em>† Indicates further administrative actions are required to fully address the vulnerability.</em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">There’s just one Critical-rated bug this month, and it deals with a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could use this bug to execute arbitrary code in the context of the SharePoint Server. While permissions are needed for this to occur, any authorized user on the server has the needed level of permissions.</p><p class="">Looking at the other RCE bugs, we see a lot of vulnerabilities in rarely used protocols. The Windows Mobile Broadband driver and the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) make up the bulk of this category. More notable are the two bugs in Hyper-V. One of these would allow an authenticated attacker to execute code on the host system. This would result in a guest-to-host escape, but Microsoft doesn’t indicate what level the code execution occurs on the host OS. After a couple of months with many SQL-related fixes, there’s just one this month. As with the previous bugs, you would need to connect to a malicious SQL server. The bug in Cryptographic Services requires a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) but could lead to a malicious certificate being imported onto the target system. The RCE bugs are rounded out with open-and-own style bugs in Excel and .NET and Visual Studio.</p><p class="">Moving on to the elevation of privilege (EoP) patches in this month’s release, almost all lead to SYSTEM-level code execution if an authenticated user runs specially crafted code. While there isn’t a lot else to say about these bugs, they are often used by attackers to take over a system when combined with a code execution bug – like the Excel bug mentioned above. They convince a user to open a specially crafted Excel document that executes the EoP and takes over the system. The lone exception to this is the bug in the Brokering File System component. The vulnerability allows attackers to gain the ability to authenticate against a remote host using the current user’s credentials. The attack could be launched from a low-privileged AppContainer, which would allow the attacker to execute code or access resources at a higher integrity level than that of the AppContainer execution environment.</p><p class="">We’ve already discussed the MotW security feature bypass (SFB), and the only other SFB vulnerability receiving a fix this month is the MSHTML engine. Just when you thought you were safe from Internet Explorer, the Trident engine rears its ugly head. This bug allows an unauthenticated attacker to get code execution if they can convince a user to open a malicious document. The code execution occurs in the context of the user, so this is another reminder not to log on with Admin privileges unless you absolutely need to.</p><p class="">There are only seven information disclosure bugs receiving fixes this month, and we’ve already covered the one in SharePoint. As usual, most of these vulnerabilities only result in info leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. The bug in Power BI could result in the disclosing of “sensitive information,” but Microsoft doesn’t narrow down what type of “sensitive information” could be leaked. Similarly, the bug in Deployment Services could leak “file contents.” Microsoft provides no information on whether that’s any arbitrary file contents or only specific files, so your guess is as good as mine.</p><p class="">The May release includes four spoofing bugs. The first is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bug in Azure Migrate. There’s not a straightforward patch for this one. You need the latest Azure Migrate Agent and ConfigManager updates. More info on how to do that can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/common-questions-appliance#how-to-troubleshoot-auto-update-failures-for-azure-migrate-appliance.">here</a>. There are two spoofing bugs in Dynamics 365, but they read more like XSS bugs. The final spoofing bug addressed this month is in the Bing search engine. An attacker could modify the content of the vulnerable link to redirect the victim to a malicious site.</p><p class="">There’s a single Tampering bug addressed in this release fixing a bug in Microsoft Intune Mobile Application Management. An attacker could gain sensitive information on a target device that has been rooted.</p><p class="">The final bugs for May are Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities in ASP.NET, DHCP server, and Hyper-V. Unfortunately, Microsoft provides no additional information about these bugs and how they would manifest on affected systems.</p><p class="">There are no new advisories in this month’s release.</p><p class=""><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p class="">The next Patch Tuesday of 2024 will be on June 11, and I’ll return with details and patch analysis then. Until then, stay safe, happy patching, and may all your reboots be smooth and clean!</p>

<title>The April 2024 Security Updates Review</title>
<link>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/4/9/the-april-2024-security-updates-review</link>
<guid>https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2024/4/9/the-april-2024-security-updates-review</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="">It’s the second Tuesday of the month, and Adobe and Microsoft have released a fresh crop of security updates. Take a break from your other activities and join us as we review the details of their latest advisories. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>





















  
  






  <p class=""><strong>Adobe Patches for April 2024</strong></p><p class="">For April, Adobe released nine patches addressing 24 CVEs in Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Commerce, InDesign, Experience Manager, Media Encoder, Bridge, Illustrator, and Adobe Animate. The largest of these updates is for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb24-21.html">Experience Manager</a>, however, all of the bugs being patched are simple Cross-site Scripting (XSS) bugs. Still, if exploited, these Important-severity bugs could lead to code execution if exploited. The only other patches that address multiple CVEs are the fixes for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/animate/apsb24-26.html">Animate</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb24-18.html">Commerce</a>. The patch for Animate addresses four bugs. Two of these are rated Critical and could lead to arbitrary code execution. The patch for Commerce also fixes two Critical-rated bugs, one XSS and one improper input validation bug. Both could lead to code execution. </p><p class="">Then we have several patches that are all info leaks due to an Out-Of-Bounds (OOB) read. These were all reported by the same person, and it makes me wonder if there is shared code between these products that makes them all vulnerable. In any case, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/after_effects/apsb24-09.html">After Effects</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/photoshop/apsb24-16.html">Photoshop</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/indesign/apsb24-20.html">InDesign</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/bridge/apsb24-24.html">Bridge</a>, and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb24-25.html">Illustrator</a> all fall into this category. That just leaves the update for <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/media-encoder/apsb24-23.html">Media Encoder</a>. This patch fixes a single buffer overflow that could lead to code execution.</p><p class="">None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3.</p><p class=""><strong>Microsoft Patches for April 2024</strong></p><p class="">This month, Microsoft released a whopping 147 new CVEs in Microsoft Windows and Windows Components; Office and Office Components; Azure; .NET Framework and Visual Studio; SQL Server; DNS Server; Windows Defender; Bitlocker; and Windows Secure Boot. If you include the third-party CVEs being documented this month, the CVE count comes to 155. A total of three of these bugs came through the ZDI program. None of the bugs disclosed at Pwn2Own Vancouver are fixed with this release.</p><p class="">Of the new patches released today, only three are rated Critical, 142 are rated Important, and two are rated Moderate in severity. This is the largest release from Microsoft this year and the largest since at least 2017. As far as I can tell, it’s the largest Patch Tuesday release from Microsoft of all time. It’s not clear if this is due to a backlog from the slower months or a surge in vulnerability reporting. It will be interesting to see which trend continues.</p><p class="">None of the CVEs released today are listed as currently under active attack and none are listed as publicly known at the time of release. However, the bug reported by ZDI threat hunter Peter Girnus was found in the wild. We have evidence this is being exploited in the wild, and I’m listing it as such.</p><p class="">Let’s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with a bug we consider to be currently exploited in the wild:</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29988"><strong>CVE-2024-29988</strong></a><strong> – SmartScreen Prompt Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is an odd one, as a ZDI threat researcher found this vulnerability being in the wild, although Microsoft currently doesn’t list this as exploited. I would treat this as in the wild until Microsoft clarifies. The bug itself acts much like <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/b/cve202421412-water-hydra-targets-traders-with-windows-defender-s.html">CVE-2024-21412</a> – it bypasses the Mark of the Web (MotW) feature and allows malware to execute on a target system. Threat actors are sending exploits in a zipped file to evade EDR/NDR detection and then using this bug (and others) to bypass MotW. </p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-20678"><strong>CVE-2024-20678</strong></a><strong> – Remote Procedure Call Runtime Remote Code Execution Vulnerability<br /></strong>There is a long history of RPC exploits being seen in the wild, so any RPC bug that could lead to code execution turns heads. This bug does require authentication, but it doesn’t require any elevated permission. Any authenticated user could hit it. It’s not clear if you could hit this if you authenticated as Guest or an anonymous user. A quick search shows about 1.3 million systems with TCP port 135 exposed to the internet. I expect a lot of people will be looking to exploit this in short order.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-20670"><strong>CVE-2024-20670</strong></a><strong> – Outlook for Windows Spoofing Vulnerability<br /></strong>This bug is listed as a spoofing bug, but based on the end result of exploitation, I would consider this information disclosure. In this case, the information disclosed would be NTLM hashes, which could then be used for Spoofing targeted users. Either way, a user would need to click something in an email to trigger this vulnerability. The Preview Pane is NOT an attack vector. However, we have seen a rash of NTLM relaying bugs over the last few months. With the wide user base of Outlook, this will likely be targeted by threat actors in the coming months.</p><p class="">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-26221"><strong>CVE-2024-26221</strong></a><strong> – Windows DNS Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is one of seven DNS RCE bugs being patched this month and all are documented identically. These bugs allow RCE on an affected DNS server if the attacker has the privileges to query the DNS server. There is a timing factor here as well, but if the DNS queries are timed correctly, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target server. Although not specifically stated, it seems logical that the code execution would occur at the level of the DNS service, which is elevated. I really don’t need to tell you that your DNS servers are critical targets, so please take these bugs seriously and test and deploy the patches quickly.</p><p class="">Here’s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for April 2024:</p><p class=""><em>*Note that post-release, Microsoft confirmed CVE-2024-26234 is also under active attack. The table has been updated to reflect this new information</em></p>

  <p class=""><em>* Indicates this CVE had been released by a third party and is now being included in Microsoft releases</em>.</p><p class=""><em>† Indicates further administrative actions are required to fully address the vulnerability.</em></p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Moving on to the Critical-rated bugs, all impact Microsoft Defender for IoT. An authenticated attacker with file upload privileges could get arbitrary code execution through a path traversal vulnerability. They would need to upload specially crafted files to sensitive locations on the target. It’s not clear how likely this would be, but anything that targets your defensive tools should be taken seriously.</p><p class="">All told, there are almost 70 fixes for bugs that could lead to code execution in this release. The (somewhat) good news is that nearly half of these impact SQL server components. In these cases, an attacker would need to have an affected system connect to a specially crafted SQL database and perform a query. If you can socially engineer that, then you will get code execution. However, that does seem unlikely. More practically, I would concern myself with the DNS and DHCP code execution bugs in this release. I’ve already mentioned the DNS bugs. For the DHCP bugs, the attacker would need elevated privileges. This would be a good time to audit your DHCP server to see who has privileges and who should be removed. The fix for Azure Migrate is only network adjacent, but you’ll need to take extra steps to be fully protected. You need to the latest Azure Migrate Appliance's AutoUpdater, which ensures MSI installers downloaded from the Download Center have been authentically signed by Microsoft prior to installation. Check <a href="Azure%20Migrate%20Appliance's%20AutoUpdater%20which%20ensures%20MSI%20installers%20downloaded%20from%20the%20Download%20Center%20have%20been%20authentically%20signed%20by%20Microsoft%20prior%20to%20installation.">here</a> for more details. There is an update for Excel to address an open-an-own bug, but you’re out of luck if you’re on macOS. Updates for Apple users are not available yet. </p><p class="">There’s a mountain of elevation of privilege (EoP) patches in this month’s release, and in most cases, exploitation requires an attacker to log on the an affected system then run their code. Again, this usually results in getting code to elevate to SYSTEM. The Azure EoPs are a little bit different and require some extra steps. The bug in Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information, such as Azure IoT Operations secrets and potentially other credentials or access tokens stored within the Kubernetes cluster. You’ll also need to update any affected Extensions that are used in your environment and ensure you update your Azure Arc Agent. The bug in Azure Content Gallery also needs extra actions to be protected. This bug has been mitigated by the latest change to the Azure Compute Gallery (ACG) image creation permission requirements, which means you’ll need to check the permissions and possibly update them. For information on how to update permissions, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries?tabs=vhdsource%2Cazure-cli#what-rbac-permissions-are-required-to-create-an-acg-image">here</a> for details. For the Azure Monitor Agent EoP, you need to make sure you have Automatic Extension Upgrades enabled. If you don’t you can manually get the updates following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-manage?tabs=azure-portal#update">these</a> instructions. Finally, the bug in the Azure Kubernetes Service also needs some extra work. To be fully protected, you need to ensure you are running the latest version of “az confcom” and Kata Image. If you don’t have “az conform” installed, you can get the latest version by running the command “az extension add -n conform”. See the bulletin for full details.</p><p class="">Moving on to the security feature bypass (SFB) bugs, how in the world are there 23 different SFB patches for Secure Boot? As if that isn’t enough, you’ll need to take additional steps to be protected. The patch fixes the bugs, but the protections aren’t enabled by default. You’ll need to check out this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5025885">KB article</a> and follow the instructions listed there. With 23 bugs and manual actions needed to address them, I don’t think we should call it “secure” boot anymore. Other SFB bugs include one that could bypass RSA signature verification and a bug in BitLocker that could also bypass secure boot. At least that one just requires a patch and no extra steps.</p><p class="">There are more than a dozen information disclosure bugs. Fortunately, most only result in info leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. The bug in Azure AI Search could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive API Keys. While this bug has been mitigated by a recent update to Azure AI Search's backend infrastructure, you’ll need to manually rotate specific credentials that have been notified through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/overview">Azure Service Health</a> alerts. The bug in Azure Identity Library for .NET could divulge data inside the targeted website like IDs, tokens, nonces, and other sensitive information. At least there are no additional steps beyond the patch for this one. Finally, the bug in Windows DFS could disclose the ever-descriptive “sensitive information”.</p><p class="">The April release is rounded out by a handful of spoofing and denial-of-service (DoS) bugs. Microsoft doesn’t provide a lot of useful information here, but if you need to focus on something, the DoS bugs in the DHCP service are where I’d start. Shutting down DHCP for any time in an enterprise will likely lead to a “no fun at all” day.</p><p class="">Finally, Microsoft has updated <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/advisory/ADV990001">ADV99001</a> with the latest servicing stack updates. Be sure to check them out. </p><p class=""><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p class="">The next Patch Tuesday of 2024 will be on May 14, and I’ll return with details and patch analysis then. Until then, stay safe, happy patching, and may all your reboots be smooth and clean!</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Attacks on the software supply chain have occurred at a rate of at least one every two days in 2024.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>U.S. companies and IT providers have been by far the most frequent targets, accounting for one-third of all software supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>The UK, Australia, Germany, India and Japan have also been frequent targets, as have the aerospace &amp; defense, healthcare and manufacturing sectors.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>These <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-a-cyber-attack/">cyber attacks</a> are particularly damaging and costly because of their multiplication factor on downstream victims and trusted access to customer environments.&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Software supply chain attacks burst into public consciousness in 2020 with news of the SolarWinds Orion attack, and a Kaseya VSA ransomware attack in mid-2021 further underscored the risks that third-party software suppliers can pose to their unsuspecting customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Attacks resulting from infiltration of an IT supplier’s code base are relatively rare, but the software supply chain – the code, dependencies and applications that all modern organizations rely on – is a source of near-constant vulnerabilities and cyberattacks that place all organizations at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of their trusted access to IT environments, a category of security tools called third-party risk management (TPRM) has evolved to monitor the security of trusted providers – and to alert downstream users when the risk from these services has increased.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Because of their trusted access to customer environments, third-party providers are one of the biggest targets for threat actors. While codebase breaches are relatively rare, a breach of any partner’s business environment can lead to sensitive data being leaked that could give attackers a critical advantage in breaching other environments, including <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-phishing/">phishing</a>, spoofing and credential attacks. And because of the interconnectedness and increasing digital nature of the physical supply chain, any manufacturer or supplier with downstream distribution can be considered a cyber risk. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We’ll look at the frequency and nature of supply chain attacks in 2024 before we focus on important defenses that all organizations with trusted partners should have in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Common Are Software Supply Chain Attacks?&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Successful supply chain attacks have become a near-daily occurrence in 2024, according to Cyble <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-cyber-threat-intelligence/">threat intelligence</a> data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cyble’s <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/dark-web-monitoring/">dark web monitoring</a> found 90 cybercriminal claims of successful supply chain attacks in a six-month period that encompassed February 2024 to mid-August 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not surprising given their reach, IT providers suffered the greatest number of those breaches, 30, or one-third of the total, followed by technology product companies, which experienced 14 of the 90 breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aerospace &amp; defense (9 breaches), manufacturing (9 breaches), and healthcare (8 breaches) were the next most frequent victims of supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In all, 22 of the 25 sectors tracked by Cyble threat researchers have experienced a supply chain attack in 2024 (chart below).&nbsp;</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The U.S. experienced by far the greatest number of supply chain breaches claimed on the <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-the-dark-web/">dark web</a> – 31 in all – followed by the UK (10). Germany and Australia each had five, and Japan and India had four each.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Look at the Nature of Supply Chain Attacks in 2024&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Supply chain attacks in 2024 have ranged from the theft of business and customer data to the theft and hijacking of source code, but regardless of the sensitive data access, all such attacks pose a serious threat because of the reach of these suppliers. A recent report from Cyentia found that 99% of Global 2000 companies are directly connected to a vendor that has been hit by a supply chain breach. Here is a look at the range and nature of supply chain attacks and breaches thus far in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">jQuery&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 5, a supply chain attack on the JavaScript npm package manager involving trojanized versions of jQuery was discovered by cybersecurity researchers. The attack targeted the popular JavaScript library jQuery by distributing trojanized versions through npm, GitHub, and jsDelivr. The attackers modified the legitimate jQuery code to exfiltrate sensitive form data from websites. The attack's scope was significant, impacting multiple platforms and package names. The attackers used tactics like obfuscation and misleading version warnings. The attack underscored the urgent need for developers and website owners to verify package authenticity and scrutinize code for suspicious modifications to mitigate supply chain attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Polyfill&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In late June, a widespread supply chain attack hit over 100,000 websites, including many well-known names, originating from a fake domain that impersonated the Polyfill.js library to inject malware that redirected users to sports betting or pornographic sites. The malware dynamically generated based on HTTP headers, making detection challenging. The attack highlighted the risks of using external code libraries and the importance of vigilance in website security. Mitigation steps included removing cdn.polyfill.io, replacing it with secure alternatives, and caution against relying on unknown entities for JavaScript. The incident underscored the security implications of third-party scripts and the potential for malicious takeovers of widely deployed projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Programming Language Breach&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 26, <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cyber-threat-actor-and-types/">threat actor </a>(TA) IntelBroker, posting on the BreachForums cybercrime forum, claimed to offer unauthorized access to a node package manager (npm) and GitHub account pertaining to an undisclosed programming language, for US $20,000. The TA said the offer also includes access to the X (Twitter) account of the associated organization with about 100,000 followers, and private repositories with privileges to push and clone commits. Below is a screenshot of the TA’s claims: </p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">CDK Global Inc.&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 19, automotive dealership software provider CDK Global Inc. was hit by a <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack reportedly perpetrated by the Black Suit ransomware group that disrupted sales and inventory operations of many North American auto dealers, including large dealer networks belong to Group1 Automotive Inc., AutoNation Inc., Premier Truck Group, and Sonic Automotive, all of which informed U.S. authorities that they experienced a multi-week service outage and disruption to dealership operations, including those supporting sales, customer relationship management systems, inventory and accounting functions. However, none of the CDK Global customers reported any malicious activity within their networks, suggesting the attack may have been limited to a service disruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Insula Group Pty Ltd.&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On July 25, BianLian ransomware group claimed to compromise Australia-based Insula Group Pty Ltd. The company provides software solutions used in residential construction and finance broking industries. The ransomware group allegedly exfiltrated 400 GB of documents that included project data, construction data, client information, server data, and company source code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Access Offered to More than 400 Companies&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 15, IntelBroker, again appearing on BreachForums, offered to sell unauthorized access to more than 400 companies compromised via an undisclosed third-party contractor. The data allegedly included access to integration services of Jira, Bamboo, Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, SSH, SFTP, DA, Zabbix, AWS S3, AWS EC2, SVN and Terraform. Additionally, the TA also provided revenue of four significant impacted organizations. Open-source research based on the companies’ revenue and location suggested the impacted organizations could be Lockheed Martin Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, General Dynamics, and Apple Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Smart-ID&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On June 21, the functionality of the Smart-ID electronic identification and authorization app was disrupted after a cyberattack, resulting in difficulties accessing internet banking and other e-services in Latvia, Estonia and elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Cartier International SNC&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On Aug 5, IntelBroker leaked data on BreachForums allegedly pertaining to Cartier International SNC, a France-based luxury goods brand. The TA said the data was stolen from the U.S,-based BORN Group, a global digital marketing agency that specializes in digital transformation and commerce solutions. The TA claimed the data was exfiltrated from AWS S3 storage and also leveraged a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, which led to the exposure of internal files, images, and source code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Code Base Injection Not Required for Supply Chain Attack&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Threat actors don’t need to inject malicious code into a tech company’s code base to hack the software supply chain – they only need to exploit a zero-day or unpatched flaw that already exists, as happened in recent attacks hitting customers of MOVEit and Ivanti. And “software dependences,” like an open-source component used in proprietary software, can also introduce vulnerabilities, further expanding the attack surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The software supply chain falls under the broader category of third-party risk management (TPRM), the partners, vendors, service providers, suppliers and contractors who can unwittingly introduce risk into an organization’s environment. A number of studies have found that more than half of all organizations have experienced a third-party breach, and these breaches tend to be more costly than incidents that occur within an organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here are some of the best practices and technologies organizations can use to protect against these growing third-party risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Zero Trust and Cyber Resilience Help Control Supply Chain Risks&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity,</a> organizations should always “assume breach” and trust no one, and this applies to third-party partners too. If security teams assume that no one can be trusted and that no one can be given safe access to assets, they architect accordingly, with critical systems and data isolated with security controls and duplicated with ransomware-resistant backups.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The concept of <em>cyber resilience</em> has been repeatedly stressed in recent years. Instead of focusing solely on the network perimeter and endpoints, resilience and recovery should be built around critical applications and data using practices such as:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Network microsegmentation&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Strong access controls, allowing no more access than is required, with frequent verification&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>A strong source of user identity and authentication, including multi-factor authentication and biometrics, <em>and</em> machine authentication with device compliance and health checks&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Encryption of data at rest and in transit&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Ransomware-resistant backups that are immutable, air-gapped and isolated as much as possible&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Honeypots that lure attackers to fake assets for early breach detection&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Proper configuration of API and cloud service connections&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Monitor for unusual activity with SIEM, Active Directory monitoring, and data loss prevention (DLP) tools&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Routinely assessing and confirming controls through audits, vulnerability scanning and penetration tests&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Practices for Secure Development – and Third-Party Risk Management&nbsp;</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ideally, the most effective place to control software supply chain risks is in the continuous integration and development (CI/CD) process – and customers of these services also have a role to play here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Carefully vetting your partners and suppliers and requiring good security controls in contracts are ways to improve third-party security. <a href="https://cyble.com/solutions/cyber-threat-intelligence/">Cyber threat intelligence</a> services like Cyble will help you assess partner and vendor risk – and alert you to places where you may want to shore up your own security defenses. Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence module evaluates partner security in areas such as cyber hygiene, dark web exposure, spoofing activities, and attack surface and network exposure, noting specific areas for improvement, while Cyble’s AI-powered vulnerability scanning capabilities can help you find and prioritize your own web-facing vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a number of guides on supply chain risk management and best practices. These are important resources both for developers and companies evaluating third-party providers. Make security reviews and requirements part of your procurement process from the start.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here are some questions you should ask vendors and service providers as part of a digital supply chain risk assessment:&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Is the vendor’s software and hardware design process documented, repeatable and measurable?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Does the vendor maintain a software component inventory such as a software bill of materials (SBOM) that spells out the components and other attributes of software developed by the vendor and third parties?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Is the mitigation of known vulnerabilities factored into product design through product architecture, run-time protection techniques, and code review?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How does the vendor stay current on emerging vulnerabilities? What are vendor capabilities to address new <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/zero-day-exploit/">“zero day” vulnerabilities?</a>&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What controls are in place to manage and monitor production processes?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How is configuration management performed? Quality assurance? How is testing done for code quality and vulnerabilities?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What levels of <a href="https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/">malware </a>protection and detection are performed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What steps are taken to make sure products are tamper-proof? Are the back doors closed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>Are physical security measures documented and audited?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What access controls, both cyber and physical, are in place? Are they documented and audited?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How is customer data protected, stored, retained, and destroyed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What type of employee background checks are conducted and how frequently?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>What security practice expectations are there for upstream suppliers, and how is adherence to these standards assessed?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>How secure is the distribution process? Have approved and authorized distribution channels been clearly documented?&nbsp;</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Services like Cyble’s third-party risk intelligence can help you get started on this process. As more organizations make security a buying criterion, vendors will be forced to respond with better security controls and documentation.&nbsp;</p>
